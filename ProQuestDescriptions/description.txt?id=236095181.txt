Film Indexes Online is a new portal for subscribers to Film Index International (FII) and the American Film Institute Catalog (AFI Catalog), created in partnership with two distinguished film research organizations, the British Film Institute (bfi) and the American Film Institute. Film Indexes Online can be used to cross-search both FII and AFI Catalog or to search the individual databases separately.
