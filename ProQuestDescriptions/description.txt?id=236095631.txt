The  John Johnson Collection of Printed Ephemera is the first-ever electronic research collection of its kind. ProQuest has painstakingly scanned in color a portion of the John Johnson collection that resides in the Bodleian Library of Oxford, England. The resulting database provides direct access to rare primary source materials and evidence of Britainâ€™s cultural, social, industrial, and technological heritage.
