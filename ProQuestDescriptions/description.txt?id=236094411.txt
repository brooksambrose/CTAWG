The Congressional Basic subscription is the foundation of our comprehensive collection of the publications of the U.S. Congress back to 1970. An optional Congressional Indexes historical module adds documents from before 1970. The Basic service includes abstracting and indexing of all publications, plus bill tracking, legislative histories, and full text of selected documents.
