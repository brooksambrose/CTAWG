Every day, our editorial team evaluates dozens of new websites spanning the globe. Following SIRS' time-tested techniques for vetting and organizing information, each site is carefully selected for its relevance, credibility, appropriateness to students, and reliability before it's added to our SIRSÂ® WebSelect (designed for use in grades 9-14) collections. Each site includes an editor-written summary to help users quickly evaluate a site's content and mission prior to linking.
