NotesIntroduction1. See the theory-group model developed by Mullins (1973), and Griffith and Mullins(1972), based on studies of molecular biologists and sociologists during the period1930–1970.2. Tibetan, by contrast, contains a natural distinction between existential and copula;the distinction is less clear in Sanskrit, and completely lacking in Greek (Halbfass,1992: 39). The pre-philosophical propensity of the language does not correlatewell with the direction that thought took in each of these regions.3. Although I do not pursue the networks of philosophers up to the current generation,Chapters 13 and 14 show the connections of many of their predecessors,including Durkheim, Freud, Wittgenstein, and Husserl.1. Coalitions in the Mind1. Hence the well-established relationship between frequency of interaction and conformityof belief (Homans, 1950). Scheff (1988) shows how tightly focused groupinteraction results in cognitive conformity by generating pride, the positive emotionof what I would call the ritual bond, or shame, the negative emotion of beingexcluded from the focus of interaction.2. Note that to negotiate the next in a chain of situations, using the symbolic capitalaccumulated in previous rituals, is not the same as following a set of meta-rules.Symbols, like rules, are idealized cognitive constructs which participants may focuson within situations and thereby impose a subjective interpretation of what is goingon. But the cognitive meaning of the symbols is not what is guiding the interactionritual; they are precipitates of the more basic coordination of action which determinesthe ritual intensity of the encounter. Ritual practices do not happen becausepeople are following rules on how to carry out IRs; the ingredients listed as 1–6are naturally occurring forms of social interaction.3. It has been calculated that 10 percent of all articles in some fields are never cited,perhaps never read (Price, 1986: 108; Hagstrom, 1965: 229). As we shall see, thereis an enormous differential in intellectual exposure between the small numbers ofpublications with many readers and the large numbers with few.9474. The term is Pierre Bourdieu’s ([1979] 1984; Bourdieu and Passeron, [1970] 1977).There are some similarities between my approach and Bourdieu’s. Both of ourworks derive from empirical studies of education’s effects on stratification and ofthe inflationary market for educational credentials. In early work (Collins, 1971)I used the term status group culture for what I now call cultural capital. I disagreewith Bourdieu’s principle that the intellectual field is homologous to the social spaceof non-intellectuals, however; the dynamics of struggle over the intellectual spaceis shaped in a distinctive way by the law of small numbers; and the cultural capitalspecific to the forefront of intellectual competition is not the cultural capital ofeducated persons generally, and it is not directly transposable with economiccapital, in either direction.5. The short-term, disruptive emotions are best explained as departures from abaseline of emotional energy, and thus are affected by the EE trajectory at anyparticular time. A full theory of emotions must include both levels. See Collins(1990); and on the sociology of emotions more generally, Kemper (1990); Scheff(1990).6. A writing style is the precipitate of a particular kind of emotional energy flow. Acrabbed and involuted style, full of false starts and shaky transitions, comes froma weak and hesitant EE flow. The writer who hides the speaker’s voice behind anunbroken wall of abstractions and technicalities is clinging to his or her identityinside the community of intellectual specialists, not at its creative core but nearenough the outer boundary to be concerned mainly with marking oneself off fromthe lay world of non-specialists outside. The distinctive styles of successful intellectuals,too, are tracks of their dominant EE flows. The sonorous periods ofGibbon bespeak his membership in a world where leading writers could be parliamentaryorators, and belonged to an aristocracy of pomp and circumstance. Thesocial sources of Russell’s and Wittgenstein’s ultra-confident styles are analyzed inChapter 13.7. In Sung China, there are the Ch’eng brothers, studying and discussing togetherfrom an early age, then spearheading the Neo-Confucian movement. In France ofthe late 1920s, there was the student circle of future literary and philosophicaleminences Jean-Paul Sartre, Paul Nizan, Raymond Aron, Simone de Beauvoir, andMaurice Merleau-Ponty (Cohen-Solal, 1987: 74–75). In London of the early 1850s,a youthful group of friends comprised Herbert Spencer, T. H. Huxley, Mary AnnEvans (George Eliot), John Tyndall, and G. H. Lewes, their important creativitystill in the future. There was the youthful friendship of Marx and Heine, or forthat matter Marx and Engels. Centuries earlier we find the schoolmates Descartesand Mersenne. This structure seems to burst forth across various fields of creativity,again suggesting that what is being circulated is not so much cultural capital asemotional energy. We could add the friendship of future novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald,critic Edmund Wilson, and poet John Peale Bishop during their student days atPrinceton University (Mizener, 1959: 36–55); or the youthful Bloomsbury circlewhich nurtured the incipient creativity across a range of literary, artistic, andscholarly fields that became famed as the work of Virginia Woolf, Lytton Strachey,John Maynard Keynes, and others (Bell, 1972).948 • Notes to Pages 29–378. The issue is not one of motivation. When an individual enters the intellectual field,the structural problem is where one will fit into the apportionment of attention.This cannot be evaded, whatever one’s values of modesty, self-effacement, orcommitment to intellectual virtues.9. Strictly speaking, for a successful IR, participants should match similar CCs, sothat they have something to talk about. For creative intellectuals, CCs cannot becompletely similar, but should overlap enough so that one or another participantcan contribute new CC to the others, and CCs can be recombined to produce newideas. Participants do not match EE levels the same way. What is necessary for asuccessful IR is that at least one person have relatively high EE, to take the initiativein getting the interaction flowing and bring the available CC into the conversation.The law of small numbers suggests that one person tends to get the most attentionin each intellectual group; two persons with very high EEs would tend to negateeach other by competing over attention. The formula for a successful IR is:matching CCs, complimentary EEs.10. We can be even more definitive. Being calculating is a particular kind of consciousthinking. Insofar as thought is itself determined by CC, EE, and surroundingnetwork opportunities, there are structural conditions under which individuals willhave sentences going through their minds such as “What will happen if I do this?Wouldn’t it be better if I . . .” We could also specify the conditions under whichindividuals think nothing of the sort but merely go with the flow. In circumstancesof steady energy flow, whether high or low, persons tend to follow their pathwithout reflecting about it. It is when energy flows are sharply contradictory, owingto network locations which pull one way and another, that conscious calculationis more likely. At the extreme, low success in IRs leading to low EE, combinedwith a multiplicity of unattractive interactional opportunities, can lead to paralyzingself-reflectiveness. The IR chain model expanded in this direction would constitutea sociological psychiatry.11. In the United States, the number of published writers of commercial (trade) booksis estimated at 45,000 (Kingston and Cole, 1986: 36).12. Kuhn’s theory asserts that there are fundamental differences between those fields(sciences) which possess paradigms and those which do not (humanities and social“science”). But stratification of creativity and recognition appears to be rathersimilar in all fields. Analysis pointing to similar structures underlying artisticcareers is given in White (1993); see also Kaufer and Carley (1993); for mathematiciansand sociologists, see Crane (1972).13. Chambliss (1989) gives a compelling image of the differences among ranks ofachievement in any competitive field, intellectual, athletic, or professional. Thereality for those in the successful inner circle is simply “the mundanity of excellence”:a smoothly applied routine of using finely tuned resources with the confidencethat one knows how to make them pay off. To those in the outer tiers,even those in the second competitive rank, there seems to be some mysteriousquality that the successful possess, and this sense of difference generates a barrierof anxiety which makes it all the more impassable.14. This sketch of a conversational artificial intelligence is amplified in Collins (1992).Notes to Pages 39–50 • 949On the levels of rhythmic coordination in conversation, see Sacks, Schegloff, andJefferson (1974); Gregory (1994).15. This should not be taken too literally. Thinking is carried out with ideas derivingfrom past conversations, which come into consciousness to the extent that theyare carried on the emotional loadings deriving from the social solidarity they havebeen associated with in past conversations. Verbal thinking does not depend onvisualizing oneself talking to an audience. One should not suppose that somepeople (i.e., “intellectuals”) have vivid imaginations, whereas most of the rest ofus prosaically go about our business of thinking without imagining audiences. Thesocial sense of ideas constitutes the very possibility of human thought.2. Networks across the Generations1. Sources for Chinese rankings (Fung, 1952–53; Needham, 1956; Chan, 1963;Ch’en, 1964; Schwartz, 1985; Kuo, 1986; CHC, 1979, 1986; Dumoulin, 1988;Graham, 1989). Sources for Greek rankings (DL, 1925 [orig. ca. 200 c.e.]; SextusEmpiricus, 1949 [orig. ca. 200 c.e.]; Suidae Lexicon, 1937 [orig. ca. 950 c.e.];Zeller, 1919; Guthrie, 1961–1982; EP, 1967; CHLG, 1967; Rist, 1969; Dillon,1977; Kirk and Raven, 1983; Long, 1986; Reale, 1985, 1987, 1990). Additionalinformation on network connections among Chinese philosophers (Ariel, 1989;Chang, 1957–1962; Cleary, 1983; Gernet, 1982; Graham, 1958, 1978; Knoblock,1988; Kodera, 1980; Liu, 1967; McMullen, 1988; McRae, 1986; Odin, 1982;Pulleybank, 1960; Smith et al., 1990; Takakusu, [1956] 1973; Welch, 1965; Welchand Seidel, 1979). Additional network connections among Greek philosophers(CHLG; DSB; OCCL; Frede, 1987; Hadas, 1950, 1952, 1954; Jonas, 1963;Tarrant, 1985; Rawson, 1985).2. I assume three active generations per century, corresponding to the typical periodof creative maturity within an individual lifetime. Hence each individual typicallyoverlaps the lifetimes of the creative generations immediately before and after: untilage 33 or thereabouts, as pupil or protégé of the elder; thereafter as mentor orobstacle to the younger. Corroborating my use of 33 years as a generation,succession charts of Buddhist lineages show an almost exact correspondence to thefigure of three generations per century. See Kodera (1980: 98), which gives asuccession of 39 generations in 1,300 years; and the Ch’an lineages in Dumoulin(1988: 328–335).3. The Chinese average is affected by some long empty spells: 21 generations out of63 in which there are neither major nor secondary figures, although there are minorfigures scattered throughout. Leaving aside these empty generations, as well as the6 empty generations in the Greek networks, gives us averages which are almostidentical: 0.6 major philosophers and 1.5 secondary ones per generation for China,0.6 major and 1.6 secondary for Greece.4. One might suppose that creativity is based on a randomly distributed trait, a raretrace element of human physiology or psychology; hence it should occur morefrequently when populations are larger. But neither in China nor in Greece iscreativity regularly related to population size. We might restrict this finding by950 • Notes to Pages 52–58assuming that creativity can come out only in the literate population; but widehistorical variations in the literacy rate do not correlate with creativity (estimatesfrom McEvedy and Jones, 1978; CHC, 1986, 1979; Rawson, 1985; Havelock,1982; Jones, [1964] 1986: 874–879, 910–912, 930–934, 992; Mann, 1986: 206–207, 253–256, 269, 313–316, 336). And we shall see that the concentration ofcreativity continues even within the massive highly educated populations of moderntimes.5. These initial ratings are relative to any given history: comprehensive volumes treatmore individual figures; specialized histories of particular eras or schools of thoughtoffer comparisons only within their scope; longer books allow lengthier treatmentsof particular philosophers. Sources include both ancient and modern ones. Thereare, of course, differences: Sextus Empiricus, Diogenes Laertius (both ca. 200 c.e.),and the Suidas (ca. 950 c.e.) have somewhat different priorities than we do.Diogenes Laertius gives 75 pages to Epicurus and 71 to Zeno of Citium but only49 to Plato. Aristotle is treated as a distinctly secondary figure, receiving 19pages—the same as Aristippus and less than Pyrrho’s 22 pages (Greek text, 1925Loeb edition). Diogenes’ relatively modest assessment of Plato was a minorityposition in his day, and Diogenes’ preference for Epicureanism was something ofa last gasp for that philosophy. The Suidas (Byzantium) shows virtually no interestin Latin authors, and does not even mention Lucretius, Seneca, or Augustine. Italso shows little interest in Christian or heretic philosophers, ignores most of theMiddle Platonists, and is very spotty on the Presocratics, giving Heraclitus only 1reference, compared to 32 for Aristotle and 75 for Plato. Among the Neoplatonists,Plotinus gets a surprisingly low 3 references, Porphyry 13, Proclus 26. DiogenesLaertius, writing some 15 generations after the classic age of Greek philosophers,was of course no more of a contemporary than we are, and the Suidas is 20generations later than that. My method averages together reputations from differentperiods, using generous cutting points so that persons who had major reputationsfor any extended period of time are listed as at least secondary in the overallscheme.6. Not to be confused with Euclid the Alexandrian geometer, 100 years later.7. In the Confucian school, the canon had an especially privileged position; from theHan dynasty onwards, it comprised the books which were officially recognized bythe state, and which in later dynasties were used as texts for civil service examinations.8. Compare the figures to whom Sorokin gives most attention in his ContemporarySociological Theories of 1928 (in rank order from the top): LePlay, Huntington,Pareto, Marx, Durkheim, Coste, Engels, De Roberty, and LaPouge. Weber ranksin the next group of secondary figures along with Winiarsky, Hobhouse, Gumplowicz,Ammon, and Gobineau. Our current pantheon members Simmel, Toennies,Comte, Cooley, and Thomas are treated as minor figures; George HerbertMead is not mentioned at all.9. In the Greek networks, a couple of important incidental figures connect the greatRoman Stoics Seneca and Epictetus: the emperor Nero and Epaphroditus (187 inFigure 3.6), Nero’s secretary and owner of the slave Epictetus. Incidental personsNotes to Pages 58–63 • 951also figure in our representation of formally organized schools; because of the carewith which lineage transmission records were treated by the Buddhist sects, weusually know the names of sect leaders for generations, even if there is nothingsignificant to be said about their own doctrines.10. The periphery is the world of the autodidact, and home of the myth of posthumousglory. Though one might hope to find “closet creativity” here, untrammeled byconformity to the fashions of the center, the reality is almost the reverse. Peripheralintellectuals may combine ideas in different ways from what the intellectuals ofthe current core are doing, yet they depend on cultural capital transmitted fromthe past, only with a greater lag. I recall an undergraduate student—older than theothers, someone who had come back to school on his own—coming up to meexcitedly after a sociology class, proclaiming his discovery: social change is neithera straight-line evolution nor a cycle but their combination in a spiral. I hadn’t theheart to tell him that he was working on the ideas of Vico and Condorcet, morethan half a dozen generations behind his time.11. Where formal schools constitute probable connections among known individualsvia unknown intermediaries (marked “x”), they are indicated as dotted lines. Thisdotted-line symbolism is also used for connections which are likely but not certain.In some cases, these formal school connections run through persons labeled “i”:those whose names are known incidentally because of their connection to a moreeminent philosopher rather than mentioned because of notable accomplishmentsin their own right (for example, see the Ch’an lineages in Figures 6.3 and 6.4). Theproblem of incomplete information, especially as it affects our view of ancientnetworks, is considered in Appendix 2.12. To avoid misunderstanding, it is worth underlining what the network chart isabout. Everyone has a social milieu that is much larger than the ties shown on thechart, including many persons who are not intellectuals as well as some who are.What this network displays are ties among philosophers who have achieved at leastsome minimal degree of eminence in intergenerational memory.13. Incidental figures are excluded from these calculations of immediate connections,since they are listed only because they are known from their connection to a morefamous figure rather than in their own right. They are however, included insubsequent calculations where they mediate links to more distant philosophers ofhigher rank.14. Once again let us understand the substantive significance of my methodology. Ifwe could add links to a chain indefinitely, and we included any persons in thesechains whatsoever as long as they eventually link up to someone of eminence, wecould undoubtedly connect anyone to anyone else in the history of the world. The“small world” studies on social networks in the 1960s (Travers and Milgram,1969) show that many Americans can communicate with a high-status personunknown to them within about six links or so. To guard against this possibility, Iallow “incidental” figures (those marked “i”) into the networks only as one-linkconnections between members of the well-known intellectual community. Moreover,experimental studies of message transmission show that communications tendto become garbled after a few links. What this implies for our intellectual networks952 • Notes to Pages 64–67is that two-link connections may be providing cultural capital as well as emotionalenergy, and four-link connections are important mainly because of the structuraleffects of belonging to a dense creative chain or community; they may shapecreative energy but do not significantly transmit cultural capital.15. The chart might scatter major and minor figures about with no ties among them;this, of course, would mean not that they had no social contacts at all, but thattheir immediate circles, teachers, and pupils are too unimportant to appear onthe chart. The isolates actually appearing in the network charts are given in Appendix1.16. On various lists, down through late antiquity, the number of sages varies, sometimesto 10, and the membership fluctuates. Thales, along with Solon, is the mostconstant across all lists.17. Confucius (fl. 480 b.c.e.) was deified in the mid-Han dynasty, and his cult receivedofficial recognition from around 60 c.e. until the end of the dynasty (200 c.e.),and again from the mid-Tang (ca. 700) onwards. Mencius (fl. 320 b.c.e.) wasworshipped in Confucian temples after about 1100 c.e., Chu Hsi after 1241 andagain following political interruptions from 1313 onwards (Fung, 1952–53: 2:534;Needham, 1956: 31).18. Undoubtedly later figures also have had their reputations swollen by the success oftheir long-term followers. Socrates is so celebrated because many schools branchedoff from him, and his fame was highest during the time when those schoolsflourished. Plato’s dominant standing, above other major philosophers, is partlydue to the Neoplatonic school, which used him as a legitimating figure for doctrinesthat diverged fairly substantially from his own emphases. But here we are justadding glory to glory. Socrates, Plato, and other cases of this sort that one couldmention—for instance Mencius, Chu Hsi, and the Tao Te Ching author—areunquestionably major creators of new ideas; they mark turning points in thenetworks of their own day, and are not merely emblems for turning points whichhappen later, although this is also true.19. See the cases cited in Chapter 1, note 7; or the section “A Cascade of CreativeCircles” in Chapter 10. In European philosophy, where biographical data are mostabundant, there are relatively few connections which consist only in a “clubbingtogether” of the famous. For instance, Hume brought Rousseau to England in1766, at the end of both their creative lives. But both Hume and Rousseau hadother important network connections earlier, noted in Figure 11.1. Where contactsconsist only of this “club of the famous,” I have not included such ties in thenetwork charts.20. Chinese books at this time were written on pieces of bamboo tied together withcords, and hence were rather bulky.21. Guthrie (1961–1982: 2:388); Hadas (1954: 64–67). Anaxagoras’ book was on salein Athens for a drachma, relatively cheap at about a day’s wage for a skilled worker.There were professional copyists at Athens, and by 50 b.c.e. at Rome; in Cicero’sday one way to acquire a book was to borrow it from someone else and set one’sslaves to copying it (Rawson, 1985: 42–45). Libraries began to be collected, at firstwithin the philosophical schools themselves, at the time of Aristotle. The HellenisticNotes to Pages 69–72 • 953kings competed over possession of great libraries, first at Alexandria (soon after300 b.c.e.), at Pergamum (190 b.c.e.) and Rhodes (100 b.c.e.), and thereafter inthe houses of wealthy Romans (OCCL, 1937: 64; Rawson, 1985: 39–42). In Chinathere is mention of bookshops in the Han capital Loyang ca. 50 c.e., whichprovided the impoverished young Wang Ch’ung his learning (CHC, 1986: 1:633–64). Imperial libraries existed from the first unified dynasty, the Ch’in, onwards.22. The prevalence of personal ties among creative intellectuals is documented in manyother modern fields besides philosophy (Griffith and Mullins, 1972; Crane, 1972).Zuckerman (1967) shows that Nobel Prize–winning scientists are most likely tohave been trained in the laboratories of previous Nobel Prize winners.23. Later in the book I will occasionally zoom in on individuals whom we know agreat deal about, attempting to show how their trajectory through micro-sociologicalnetworks shaped their personality, (e.g., Peirce, in Chapter 12; Wittgensteinin Chapter 13; Sartre in Chapter 14). At least two of the three, I dare say, mightwell have admitted the validity of this kind of analysis.24. Detailed analysis, including the pattern of apparent exceptions to this general rule,is given in Appendix 1.25. These figures can hardly be taken as exact. For reasons discussed in Chapter 12,our ability to judge the long-term reputations of intellectuals becomes less reliableas we near our own generation; totals after 1835 are probably inflated, and after1900 are surely unrealistic. On the one hand, the Japanese network may overstatethe number of secondary figures by including some who are publicized only inhistories of Zen Buddhism; on the other hand, the total of minor figures could beexpanded by including more from Buddhist sources. For India, the number ofimportant thinkers is no doubt understated owing to the large amount of creativitybefore 400 c.e. which took the form of anonymous or pseudonymous religioustexts. In general, information on which the Indian network was based is sparser,and dating more conjectural, than for the other world networks. The world totalis also incomplete insofar as several of the networks are truncated, justified by thelesser influence of philosophers of recent centuries; for example, I have traced theChinese network only through 1565 c.e. In my view the most important omissionsare the networks of Buddhist philosophers in Tibet and Korea (although some ofthe founders of the Tibetan lineages are found in the Indian network in the key toFigures 5.4 and 5.5).3. Ancient Greece1. We thus see why, as Holton ([1973] 1988) documents, the themata of intellectualdiscourse usually come in opposing pairs or trios. Holton lists a large number ofopposing themata from the history of scientific theories. The fact that Holton’s listof oppositions is much larger than the three to six positions specified in the lawof small numbers implies that what is constant is not a set of deep-rooted cognitiveschemata repeating throughout history but rather the structural condition of splitting.954 • Notes to Pages 73–812. These external conditions are prominent in historical and sociological accounts ofthe emergence of Greek philosophy (Lloyd, 1987, 1990; Bryant, 1996).3. From Latin calculus, Greek chalix: pebble.4. The family migrated to Boeotia, a rather backwoods region of mainland Greece.Hesiod is known to have read a poem at a festival at Chalcis, on the island ofEuboea. But he wrote in the cosmopolitan language Ionian, not Boeotian (OCCL,1937: 207–208).5. For this reason I have included probable connections in Figure 3.1 for severalpersons: Pythagoras’ youth coincided with Anaximander’s maturity and fame atnearby Miletus; given Pythagoras’ reputation for wide travels, it seems likely thathe would have heard the latter personally, although the sources do not mention it.Hecataeus of Miletus, an exact contemporary of Heraclitus, played a major rolein organizing the Ionian revolt of 499–494 b.c.e. and traveled widely. He musthave been at the neighboring city of Ephesus, and in his public capacity couldhardly have been unacquainted with Heraclitus, an official of the local temple.Hecataeus was known as a geographer; given the connection of cosmology withgeography at this time, Hecataeus likely connects with the chain of cosmologicalphilosophers at Miletus (Guthrie, 1961–1982: 1:74, 173; DSB, 1981: 6:212).6. Similarly, ancient sources attributed the origins of the atomist Leucippus to bothMiletus and Elea (Guthrie, 1961–1982: 2:384). Elea was an Ionian colony, andMiletus was the most actively colonizing city of Ionia (Barraclough, 1979: 75).7. Plato is reputed to have paid the princely sum of 40 minas (about 4,000 drachmas)for this book (Kirk, Raven, and Schofield, 1983: 324).8. There was a chain of teachers at Cos down through 280 b.c.e.; after that pointits leaders, such as Herophilus (107 in the key to Figure 3.5) and Erasistratus (108),migrated to Alexandria (DSB, 1981: 4:104, 382; 6:316). This was reorganizationrather than intellectual death; medical doctrines were simultaneously appearing atAthens, branching off from Aristotle’s school, especially that of Diocles (76), whoformalized Hippocratic materials using the categories of philosophy. Within ageneration medicine, as well as natural science, was firmly institutionalized atAlexandria in the Museum (von Staden, 1989).9. The Library was begun under Ptolemy (r. 323–283) and greatly expanded underhis son Ptolemy II (r. 285–246), who is said to have purchased Aristotle’s collectionof books (OCCL, 1937: 22, 138, 241, 281; Hadas, 1954: 21–24). The Museum,founded under Ptolemy II, supported literary scholars and also scientists. It is likelythat both Ptolemy patronized individual scholars even before this formal institutionwas created; Strato was the tutor of Ptolemy II before returning to Athens as headof the Lyceum.10. Epicurus had taught earlier at Lampsacus (on the Hellespont) and Mytilene (in thenortheastern Aegean), where he formed his first community of followers. Otherearly branches were established at Antioch and Alexandria (Long, 1986: 17). TheEpicurean community was organized into ranks, with the wise man at the top(Epicurus himself and his successors), followed by associate leaders, assistants, andpupils (Rist, 1972: 9–12). Probably the subordinate communities and lower ranksNotes to Pages 82–94 • 955of membership included persons in lay life who provided material support for theintellectual elite.11. The master-pupil chains, which we can trace down to 50 b.c.e. in the case of theAcademics, Stoics, and Epicureans, break up after 200 b.c.e. in the case of theAristoteleans, although there are scattered names of notable members of the schoolthrough the next three generations, and the scholarch of the Peripatos was part ofthe delegation of Athenian ambassadors to Rome in 156–55 b.c.e., along with theheads of the Academy and the Stoa.12. The old Academy was physically deserted; Antiochus of Ascalon (d. 68 b.c.e.)lectured at a gymnasium near the Agora, the original property having apparentlylapsed (Dillon, 1977: 60, 232). After 50 b.c.e. the Epicurean Garden was sold andthe school became defunct at Athens (Reale, 1985: 183–184, 413).13. The higher numbers apply if we count the medical schools and the AlexandriaMuseum.14. Zeno of Elea, for example, was famous for taking part in democratic politicalmovements; he was allegedly killed by a tyrant of Elea or Syracuse (DSB, 1981:14:607–608). Empedocles was active both in politics and in practicing medicine(Guthrie, 1961–1982: 2:131).15. But Gorgias, Prodicus, Hippias, and others also served as ambassadors of theirnative cities, and Protagoras was entrusted by Pericles with drafting legal codes(Guthrie, 1961–1982: 3:264, 270, 274, 281).16. There were many scandalous stories, such as of Crates and his wife, Hipparchia,who mated under their cloaks in public, gave away their daughter for a 30-daytrial marriage, and—a violation of sexist convention—attended (all-male) dinnerparties together (DL, 1925: 6:97; Reale, 1985: 381–382, 30–34).17. There is no indication that the Pythagoreans themselves had connected theirmathematics with their transmigration doctrine. It was left for Plato to do this,because he was using their cultural capital in a different context: the competitionagainst an active intellectual field of relativists armed with self-conscious logicalstandards of argument. The classical Pythagoreans, by contrast, apparently did notconfront epistemological issues (cf. Morgan, 1990; Burkert, 1972).18. Aristotle was not consistently hostile to mathematics, since he contributed to theformalization of proofs by pointing out the role of definitions, hypotheses, andaxioms (in Posterior Analytics). The trajectory of his split probably developed asthe religious cult of mathematics grew up around his rival for the succession asscholarch, Speusippus. Conversely, the Aristotelean school later returned to mathematics,after the Academy repudiated its number religion and turned to skepticism.19. Three if we count the Alexandrian Library and Museum; this, however, wasconnected at first with the Aristotelean school and provided an alternate basewhich kept the school alive during the political upheavals after Alexander’s death.20. As we see in Figure 3.4, Zeno emerged from extremely wide connections, as pupilof Academics, Megarians, Cynics, Eretrians, and even studying medicine in Alexandria(Frede, 1987: 230). His syncretism comes from this confluence of diversecultural capitals.956 • Notes to Pages 94–10621. Archimedes studied at Alexandria; though he resided in Syracuse, he “published”his results in letters to his Alexandrian mathematical friends ca. 240 b.c.e.22. Eudoxus had moved at least part of his mathematical school from Cyzicus toCnidus a generation or two previously (DSB, 1981: 4:465–467); it is possible thatthe mathematics at Alexandria was fostered by a further migration of the remnantsof that school, at the same time as the medical scholars.23. “The logic of propositions, which [the Stoics] studied, is more fundamental thanthe logic of general terms, which Aristotle studied . . . Aristotle’s syllogistic takesits place as a fragment of general logic in which theorems of primary logic areassumed without explicit formulation, while the dialectic of Chrysippus appearsas the first version of primary logic” (Kneale and Kneale, 1984: 175–176). “WhenClement of Alexandria [late 100s c.e.] wishes to mention one who is master amonglogicians, as Homer is master among poets, it is Chrysippus, not Aristotle, whomhe names” (ibid., 116).24. The Epicurean Philodemus had a school at Naples around 50 b.c.e., but theenterprise lapsed with his death (Rawson, 1985). Epictetus taught Stoicism in exileat Epirus (the backwoods of northwestern Greece) after 100 c.e., but his successfulschool was not perpetuated.25. Later, the most famous developers of Empiricist medical doctrine, Menedotus andTheodas (100s c.e.), were also the main representatives of skepticism, leading upto Sextus Empiricus. The connection is further supported by the fact that medicalEmpiricism and philosophical skepticism both disappear together after 200 c.e.26. This was not strictly accurate. There were a few Epicurean renegades, such asTimocrates in the founding generation (who wrote a scathing exposé of thecommunity’s practices), and Metrodorus of Stratonicea, who joined the Academyin Carneades’ generation (Frischer, 1982: 50–51; Tarrant, 1985: 94). But this isnothing like the shifting of personnel among the other schools: Zeno himself,Arcesilaus, and Chrysippus all built up their cultural capital through such moves.27. Both circles were concerned with poetry, a high-prestige art in Rome at this time.Epicurean doctrine survived mainly because it was embodied in Lucretius’ Latinmasterpiece. In the other school, as Figure 3.5 indicates, one of Philodemus’ pupilswas Virgil.28. When Platonists reappeared at Athens from 50 c.e. onwards, they were notdescribed as scholarch or diadochos (successor), although some of them (such asCalvenus Taurus, ca. 100–165 c.e.) had their own private schools (Dillon, 1977:232–233, 237–239).29. A handsome sum, since a day’s wage for a skilled workman was about onedrachma, and a year’s salary for a Roman legionary about 1,000 sesterces, roughlyequivalent to 250 drachmas (OCCL, 1937: 277–278; Finley, 1973: 79–80, 104).30. On the social role of the rhetorician (who often doubled as legal advocate) and ofthe grammarians who prepared students for the rhetoric schools, see Kaster (1988).31. The organizational weakness of pagan cults was that they had few if any full-timepriests (Jones, [1964] 1986: 933). Their upkeep was usually tied to the local gentry;for instance, Plutarch of Chaeronea was among other things a priest of nearbyNotes to Pages 107–122 • 957Delphi. The Gnostics, although nontraditional in doctrine and elitist in membership,shared this traditional organization style of part-time leaders with merelylocal roots. The traditional Egyptian temples with their extensive property werean exception to this amateur pattern, but their circles were very parochial.32. Another pro-Christian emperor, Gallienus, who called off the Decian persecutions,vetoed Plotinus’ project for the religious community “Platonopolis” (CHLG, 1967:202).33. This is not to deny that there were external organizational and political factorsinvolved in the heresy disputes, but rather to stress that there were internalintellectual issues involved as well, which had their own sociological impetus insidethe intellectual community. The heresies emerged when there was a coordinationof the two levels of struggle.34. The tendency of Middle Platonism to become relatively more associated withChristianity may well be another reason why Plotinus formulated a rival Neoplatonistdoctrine for the anti-Christian coalition.35. Of the eight great Latin and Greek doctors recognized by the church, seven workedin the generation of the 360s to the 390s: Ambrose, Augustine, Jerome, Basil ofCappadocia, Gregory of Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa, and John Chrysostom(Attwater and John, 1983: 41, 107, 194). This is the period immediately after thefailure of Julian’s restoration of the pagan cults in 362–363. The only major churchfather not in this generation is Pope Gregory the Great, active 575–604.36. Once inside the church, it was not difficult to choose a winning faction. In 386the Manichees were purged at Carthage; in 388 a Donatist bishop was executed;in 391 the emperor issued a general edict against paganism; in 399 imperial agentsclosed pagan shrines in Africa (Brown, 1967: 74, 184, 187). Carthage, a land oforganizational struggle among Catholics, Donatists, and Manichees, was just theplace to produce a thinker like Augustine. An ingredient of his greatness was theopportunity to define the doctrinal content of orthodoxy for the victorious organizationalfaction.37. It was about this time that Neoplatonism had its last upsurge, with the formalreestablishment of the Academy at Athens and Alexandria. Neoplatonism made auseful religion for educated pagans under Christian power, since it favored innerworship approached via philosophy rather than exterior cult practices at just thetime when the latter were being abolished.4. Ancient China1. Historical sources are often vague regarding the lives of intellectuals of early China,as they are for Greece and India. What follows here is an attempt at coherentreconstruction of how the oppositions of the intellectual community unfolded. Itshould be understood throughout, without repeated caveats in the text, that aninterpretation is being offered. Occasional footnotes cite evidence in regard tocontroversial points about the dating. Network sources for Chapters 4 and 6 arethose given in Chapter 2. On Chinese social history, see Eberhard (1977); Gernet(1982); CHC (1986).958 • Notes to Pages 125–1382. Han Fei Tzu mentions eight schools (Han Fei Tzu, [sect. 50], 1964: 118), HsünTzu mentions 5 major schools of Confucian ju (scholars), although perhaps onlya smaller number survived down into contemporary times (250 b.c.e.) (Knoblock,1988: 214–220, 224–229).3. Mo Ti himself led 180 soldiers. All the Mohists in the state of Ch’u—a total of83—were wiped out in a siege in 381 b.c.e. (Fung, 1952–53: 1:82). By 280 themajor armies were perhaps on the order of 100,000 men (Knoblock, 1988: 8);Eberhard (1977: 49), however, suggests only around 10,000.4. A parallel development occurred in Europe during the 1600s: the internationalnetwork of diplomats, religious emissaries, and soldiers of fortune became forseveral generations the base of the new intellectual community which formedoutside traditional positions in the church (see Chapter 10).5. This collection of intellectuals also produced what was becoming the prestigeintellectual product: an encyclopedia of knowledge under the standard title, Springand Autumn Annals (in this case) of Master Lü (the prime minister). Spring andAutumn Annals was the title of a Confucian text, attributed to Confucius himself.6. There remained for a while groups such as the augurs in Rome, but even in thisreligiously conservative city-state the college of pontifices was monopolized bypoliticians (OCCL, 1937: 65, 342; Rawson, 1985). There were some hereditarypriests in Greece as late as 500 b.c.e. who played an occasional role in philosophy;Heraclitus came from such a priestly family in the cult center of Ephesus, and hisimprecations upon the new secular philosophers were probably related to theirprofessional challenge. There are also shamanistic aspects to figures such as Empedoclesand Heraclides Ponticus and in the medical cult of the Asclepiades. Buteven they were not especially concerned to restore the ancient rites, which wouldhave seemed outside the realm of political possibility.7. Plato is the principal exception here. Of all the Greek philosophers, he is closestto the Chinese pattern of centering his analysis on political projects, and in theLaws he proposes an ideal state centered on a compulsory but non-traditional cult.But this political interest was confined to Plato’s own lifetime; the Academy, inboth its phases of astral religion and skepticism, quickly fell back into the mainstreampattern of Greek intellectuals in focusing on the inner lives of individuals.If there is a tradition of “Western individualism,” it originated in the autonomyof political struggle from religious legitimation.8. In the absence of Hui Shih’s own texts and with minimal survivals of Kung-sunLung’s, there have been widely divergent interpretations of their positions. FungYu-lan (1952–53: 192–220) regards Hui Shih’s as a metaphysics of particulars inceaseless change, Kung-sun Lung’s as a realism of universals. Graham (1989:82–83) argues that all philosophers of this period took nominalism for granted,and interprets the paradoxes as explorations of part-whole relations. Farther afield,Reding (1985) suggests that Hui Shih’s statements derive from political arguments.The most extreme position is that of Hansen (1983), that classical Chinese languagelacks abstractions and thus constrains thought into channels totally differentfrom those of the West. This linguistic determinism is rejected by Schwartz (1985:12, 165, 168) and moderated by Graham (1989: 389–428).Notes to Pages 140–149 • 9599. The Canons refute positions of all the rival schools, including the Five Agents ofTsou Yen, but do not mention doctrines of the Tao Te Ching or the Legalists(Graham, 1978: 61). This implies a date before Han Fei Tzu popularized legalism,but at least contemporary with Tsou Yen.10. Empedocles had four elements (fire, water, earth, air) ordered by opposing principlesof strife and love. It is generally agreed that wu hsing should be rendered notas “five elements” but as “five processes” or “five agents”; hsing is “walk” or“move” with the connotation “put into effect” (Knoblock, 1988: 216–217). Major(1976) proposes “five phases.” But three of the five (wood, metal, earth) areconcrete substances, conceivable as processes only under interpretations imposedlater.11. These comprised the Odes, Documents, Rites, Changes (Yi Ching), and Spring andAutumn Annals. This culminated a struggle over precedence among a wide rangeof earlier texts, each supported by their own specialists.12. During the T’ang, relatives of the imperial house were executed or impeached forconsulting diviners (CHC, 1979: 334, 379–381; Fung, 1952–53: 16; Woo, 1932).13. It is notable that the word yi (change), and the cosmological opposites yin andyang appear for the first time in this Appendix rather than in the original divinationtexts or the earlier Appendices commenting on the interpretation of particularhexagrams (Legge, [1899] 1963: 38, 43). The argument is not very abstract; overallthe tone is more one of worldly advice than of cosmological system. The text ofthe third Appendix “makes plain the nature of anxieties and calamities, and thecauses of them” (Legge, [1899] 1963: 399), extols the superior man, and sprinklesreferences to ancient sage-kings who were allegedly inspired in their technologicalinventions by the hexagrams. This is another indication that this Appendix datesfrom the time of the burning of the books, when works on technology and otherpractical lore remained in favor.14. The Han dynasty produced considerable work in science and mathematics, althoughgenerally in other branches of the official bureaucracy than the Confucians(Needham, 1959: 19–30, 199–200, 216–219; Mikami, 1913; Sivin, 1969).15. In 37 c.e. the descendants of Confucius were ennobled, and in 59 annual sacrificesto Confucius were instituted at all schools. Wang Ch’ung wrote soon after.16. Recall that in the comparative analysis of networks in Chapter 2, Wang Ch’ung isone of the most unusual figures in all of the world history of philosophy: anindividual of at least secondary importance in the long-term attention space whohas no contemporary rivals of equal eminence, and who is not only a horizontalbut also a vertical isolate from chains of historically significant intellectuals.17. We find a similar situation in Japan during the Sengoku period, the “country atwar” (1470–1580). Vociferous public debates took place among the rival branchesof Pure Land Buddhism, but these generations are devoid of intellectual innovation.At this time the monasteries were major political powers, and their debates werean immediate part of the struggle for public prestige and military alliance.18. The Chuang Tzu (chap. 6) speaks rhapsodically about death as a natural and evendesirable process.19. Members of the “Five Pecks of Grain” movement, a health cult for the peasantry,960 • Notes to Pages 151–167for example, memorized the Tao Te Ching but gave it a vulgar interpretation. “‘TheTao that can be Tao’d,’ this is to eat good things in the morning: ‘the Tao that isnot eternal,’ this is to have a bowel movement in the evening” (Welch, 1965: 119).20. Kuo Hsiang’s major work is his commentary on the Chuang Tzu, which was inpart a continuation—and perhaps a plagiarism—of the unfinished commentary byHsiang Hsu in the previous generation. As Figure 4.4 indicates, Hsiang Hsuprobably took part in the discussions of the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove,and is indirectly linked to Wang Pi and the rationalistic interpreters of Taoism.Kuo Hsiang probably had some contact with Hsiang Hsu’s son, reportedly carelessin scattering his father’s treatise about (Fung, 1952–53: 206). Whatever the individualcontributions, the “philosophy of Kuo Hsiang” is very much a product ofthe core intellectual factions around Loyang in the late 200s.5. India1. There were eight such swings: (1) Consolidation of the numerous small kingdomsin the middle Ganges into 16 major states around 600 b.c.e., then down to 4contenders 100 years later, culminating in the Maurya Empire over almost all ofIndia ca. 300–185 b.c.e., and disintegrating thereafter. The two leading statesaround 500, Magadha and Kosala, were the first patrons of Buddhism and Jainism.(2) A three-way split among leading states, peaking around 150 c.e., including thesouth-central Andhra kingdom, another Buddhist patron. (3) The Gupta Empirein the north, from 335 c.e. to the late 400s. (4) Harsha’s reconquest of Guptaterritory around 600–650. (5) In the late 800s another three-way struggle in thenorth, including the last great patron of Buddhism, the Pala kingdom in Bengal,expanding westward into the ancient Magadha heartland. The last three cyclesprior to the British Empire involve Muslim invaders from the northwest; in counterpoint,Hindu kingdoms in the far south attain their maximal size. (6) Around1000, the Ghaznavid Muslim empire centered in Iran and central Asia conqueredthe northwest; meanwhile the Chola Empire expanded in the south. (7) AnotherMuslim conquest in the late 1100s, expanding by 1335 to almost all of India exceptthe far south, then disintegrating rapidly after 1340. In the south the kingdom ofVijayanagar attains its greatest size in the 1500s. (8) The Mogul conquest fromAfghanistan in the 1560s, spreading south in the 1600s; its disintegration after1770 leaves the power vacuum filled by European overseas empires (Davies, 1949;OHI, 1981; Dutt, 1962; Thapar, 1966; Craven, 1975; Zürcher, 1962; Gombrich,1988; Chandler and Fox, 1974).2. The centralizing Maurya dynasty arose on the basis of a succession of parricidekings. The Arthashastra, or classic of statecraft, composed at this time, advocatedthe most blatant tactics of treachery and espionage as the path to artha, worldlysuccess.3. Hence the lower Ganges province takes its name, Bihar, from vihara, monastery.On Buddhist support, see OHI, (1981: 169–173); Dutt (1962: 331; 225–230).4. Sharma (1965); Mann (1986: 356–357); OHI, (1981: 112–113, 178–179, 206–208). An exception to this pattern apparently occurred in coastal states of the southNotes to Pages 173–190 • 961and west, where overseas trade gave an alternative basis for state revenues. Theimportance of this pattern for state-building in the European context is shown byTilly (1990). This may be a reason why the Jainas, associated with merchants, weremajor contenders for state alliance in these regions. Conversely the Buddhists, withtheir agrarian monastic base, fit Tilly’s alternative pattern of state formation:landed revenues. Hence Buddhism declined in the south as the trade-based statesrose.5. It is worth underlining that the so-called “six darshanas” or “orthodox philosophies”(Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Yoga, Samkhya, Mimamsa, Vedanta), which are thestandard rubrics in virtually all general histories of Indian philosophy, were by nomeans static or primordial positions. The notion of “six darshanas” was notcreated until fairly late in the medieval period, and they developed, much asphilosophical schools did elsewhere, out of debates both among their own ranksand across the attention space with non-Hindu rivals. The ideology of the darshanasis part of the static bias which it is necessary to break through in order toreconstruct the actual history of Indian intellectual life.6. Sources for the networks which follow (EIP, 1977, 1981, 1987, 1990; Halbfass,1991, 1992; Isayeva, 1993; Potter, 1976; Dasgupta, 1922–1955; Chattopadhyaya,1972, 1979; Basham, 1989; Raju, 1985; Pandey, 1986; Nakamura, 1980; Dutt,1962; Hirakawa, 1990; Conze, 1962; Kalupahana, 1992; Lamotte, 1958; Stcherbatsky,1962; Phillips, 1995).7. Nakamura (1973: 33–35); Chattopadhyaya (1972: 32–40); Gonda (1975); Stutley(1980). For a position stressing the long-term unity of orthodox Hinduism sincethe early Vedas, see Smith (1994). On the other side, see Krishna (1991).8. These separate groups of teachers were recognized outside the Vedic texts as well.The Buddha himself refers to followers of the Samaveda, Rigveda, and the twoYagurvedas (Barua, 1974: 284). Krishna (1991: 83–84) argues for even moresub-splits within the schools of the Vedas.9. It is not clear when the Upanishads actually became standard parts of the Vedictransmission schools; as we shall see, the early and middle Upanishads depictfreelance sages who are quite critical of Vedic priestcraft. The reorganization ofUpanishadic lore into a broad pan-Vedic coalition may have occurred in the earlycenturies of the Common Era.10. E.g., Chand. Up. 7.1.2; Brihad. Up. 1.5.5 and 4.1.2 (700–500 b.c.e.). Somewhatlater the Aitareya (1.3.9), about 500 b.c.e., mentions only the three Vedas. TheBuddhist Jataka tales, ca. 300 b.c.e., similarly refer to the three Vedas; so doesKautilya’s Arthashastra, which itself draws on spells from the Atharva, as from aseparate tradition, as “secret means” for spying and destroying enemies (bk. 14).The earliest to list all four as Vedas is the Mundaka Upanishad (1.5), ca. 350–300b.c.e. But the late Maitriyana (6.32) still lists only three Vedas and calls the Atharva“hymns,” indicating that the canon was not settled as late as 200 c.e. Dates fromNakamura (1973: 77–78); see also OHI, (1981: 86–87, 107).11. Krishna (1991: 95–109) points out that the “Upanishads” are an inchoate categoryof texts, selected under that label from a wide variety of sources and time periods.Far from constituting “the end of the Vedas,” they were often selected from962 • Notes to Pages 193–195chapters in the midst of Brahmanas and Aranyakas, or expanded from such texts,while others were added later. Most of them originally did not use the term“Upanishad,” which in the Arthashastra (300 b.c.e.) still meant “secret weapon”rather than a religious doctrine.12. Chakravarti (1987); Mizuno (1980); Hirakawa (1990); Jacobi (1884); Dutt (1962:46–51). The Videha land, whose king sponsors debates involving such sages asYajñavalkya, is a scene of the Buddha’s life too. Both kinds of sources show kingsstriving to attract famous sages to their courts by material patronage (e.g., BrihadaranyakaUpanishad 2.1.1).13. Cf. Chandogya Upanishad 5.11 and 17; 6.1; Brihad. Up. 3.7; 6.2; KaushitakiUpanishad 1.1. This probably indicates the rivalry of the Samavedists to whichUddalaka’s Upanishad was attached, against the White Yagur, allied to Yajñavalkya’slore, as well as against the Rigvedists of the Kaushitaki.14. Brihad. Up. 3.6.1; 3.9.27; cf. Chand. Up. 1.8; 10.10–11, where the threat that“your head will fall off” invokes a magical punishment for singing a hymn withoutknowing its meaning. The implication is that winning a debate sequence wasregarded as a demonstration of superior magic.15. Akin to this may be the famous lesson of Uddalaka Aruni about breaking a seedinto infinitesimal pieces to find the invisible essence (Chand. Up. 6.12). Ruben (inChattopadhyaya, 1979: 141–156) points out that Uddalaka’s sequence of arguments(Chand. Up. 6.1–16) indicates a kind of hylozoist materialism of livingmatter; for instance, he instructs his son to abstain from eating for fifteen days inorder to show that this impairs one’s memory, concluding that “mind comes fromfood” (6.7.6). The ultimate lesson, that one’s self is part of the invisible essence ofthe universe, does not so much imply that the universe is spiritual, as that thehuman self, too, is produced from the hylozoic essence. Given the lack of distinctionbetween levels of abstraction, what later philosophers interpreted as a transcendentalmonism may just as well have been a claim for one physical elementunderlying the others, in much the same sense that Thales posited water as theprimal element. Similarly, Uddalaka’s experiment with salt invisibly pervadingwater (Chand. Up. 6.13) is primitive physics as much as it is transcendentalphilosophy.16. Brihad. Up. 6.3; this magic is attributed to Uddalaka Aruni, who gives it to his“pupil” Yajñavalkya. Similar worldly magical claims are made in some of the most“philosophical” Upanishads, e.g., Chand. Up. 2.1–29; Kaush. Up. 2.6.4–10.17. Only one of the classic Upanishads, the Maitrayani (1.3–4), equates life withsuffering, and it uses words identical with classic Buddhist phrases; this is a lateUpanishad from around 200 c.e.. (Nakamura, 1973: 77–78). Its contemporary,the Mandukya Upanishad includes phrases found in the Prajñaparamitasutras ofMahayana Buddhism.18. O’Flaherty (1980: xi–xxiv, 3–13). The clearest formulation of the karma doctrineappears again in the late Maitrayani Upanishad (3–4), in virtually Buddhist language;this is also the only Upanishad which links karma and rebirth to theperformance of caste duties (4.4.3). In the pre-Buddhist Brihad. Up. (3.2.13), adebate is described in which one question has to be discussed privately. TheNotes to Pages 195–199 • 963narrator then tells us at the end of the chapter that the interlocutors talked ofkarma. This may be a late interpolation, since the lines appear at the end of achapter. If not, it implies that karma—in whatever version at that time—was asecret doctrine, not a view that would be accepted as religiously binding by mosthearers. As late as the Bhagavad Gita, a series of interpolations in the Mahabharatainfluenced by the new Hindu philosophical schools ca. 100–500 c.e., there is amixture of conflicting doctrines about reincarnation and other forms of life afterdeath (e.g., 1.42.44; 8.6.23–25; 9.25). The thread which is retrospectively emphasized,that favorable reincarnation depends on performance of one’s duties undercaste law, becomes the dominant religious interpretation still later, in the finalonslaught against Buddhism around 700 c.e..19. For debates on these dates, see Hirakawa (1990: 22–23).20. The futile questions which the Buddha tells his followers to avoid are similar toKant’s antinomies: the beginning and end of the universe, the difference betweenbody and soul, life after death. These are favorite debating topics among theUpanishadic sages; by denying their solubility, the Buddha claims a superior levelof reflexive sophistication.21. For various translations and sources, see Nakamura (1980: 66–69; Kalupahana(1986: 10–16).22. The Ajivikas too received royal patronage, for instance, under the Maurya dynasty.Mahavira and Makkhali Gosala were close associates until their debates led to asharp break between their respective sects. Mahavira and Shakyamuni competitivelyproselytized some of the same lay patrons. But Shakyamuni’s strongestenemy, in tactical struggles in the lay community as well as in debate, was MakkhaliGosala (Mizuno, 1980: 120–141; Basham, 1951; OHI, 1981: 77, 130). This rivalryprobably resulted from the fact that Shakyamuni was both appropriating andnegating Makkhali’s key doctrine in proposing a method to overcome karmic fate.23. Mizuno (1980: 99, 104). The Jainas also preached, although not as aggressivelyas the Buddhists.24. Chakravarti (1987: 122–149). This recruitment base continued throughout thelifetime of Indian Buddhism.25. The range of meditation techniques includes one-pointed concentration, observingone’s breath, stilling the inner dialogue, focusing on consciousness itself apart fromits objects (Buddhist and Yoga techniques); visualizing energies or lights withinone’s own body, especially in the genitals; raising inner heat and moving it aboutone’s body (tantric techniques); inwardly visualizing symbols, gods, the experienceof one’s own death, the letters in the name of God, and so on (Tibetan Buddhist,Sufi, Taoist, Kabbalist techniques); outwardly focusing on visual symbols (mandalas,crucifixes, etc.); chanting mantras (pure sounds) or sutras (holy texts),singing verbal hymns; rhythmic dancing (Sufi darvish sects, medieval JapaneseAmidaists); physical activities to the point of exhaustion, or self-torture (Sufis,shramanas, Christian ascetics, shamans, tribal vision-seekers); verbal prayer orcommunication with a personified deity (Christianity); counting, slowing, or holdingbreaths (Buddhists, Taoists); blowing and spitting (Chinese Huai-nan Tzu);964 • Notes to Pages 200–206intellectual “investigation of things” (Neo-Confucians), or analysis of concepts intoemptiness (Buddhists); koan paradoxes, sometimes together with receiving shoutsand blows from one’s teacher (Ch’an); enlightenment during preaching (T’ien-t’aiand Amida Buddhism, Sufism, enthusiastic sectarian Christianity). The resultingexperiences range from tranquillity to weeping and emotional enthusiasm, from“bright light” to “divine dark” to “clear glass consciousness,” from floatingdetachment (zazen) to deep trance (samadhi) to sudden enlightenment (satori).26. Results of meditation have been conceived to involve both detachment from theworld and action in it. Detachment may be interpreted as an end in itself, or anend to individual suffering (Buddhism); as contact with God or salvation from sins(Sufism, Christianity, Mahayana); as individual psychotherapy (post-1950 Westernsecularism). Worldly results aimed at include health and longevity (Taoism); magicalpowers such as clairvoyance, levitation, and spells over other living beings(shamanistic and folk beliefs, incorporated in most mystical traditions as lesser sideeffects); political power to regulate the state (Taoism); shelter from political persecution(medieval Jewish Kabbalism); motivation of millennial political movements,ranging from nationalist particularism (Sufism, Imamism, Kabbalism) touniversalistic trans-sectarianism (Rosicrucianism, Masonism).27. In later historical cases, monasteries become organizational vehicles for settlingfrontier areas or introducing capitalist accumulation, especially in a rural economy.This is most notable in China ca. 400–800 c.e., and again in Christian Europe1050–1300 and in Japan 1200–1600. The key advantage of the monastic mode oforganization is its ability to free up and reinvest resources in a society otherwisedominated by kinship organization of production.28. Nakamura (1973: 77–79). The Mandukya Upanishad, which Gaudapada (ca.500–600) used as a basis for developing Advaita, is not attached to a Vedic schooland does not exist independently of Gaudapada’s commentary (Isayeva, 1993: 50).A good many Upanishads may have originated in this independent fashion beforeacquiring a connection with a Brahmanical lineage and canonical status from laterscholars. Some Upanishads became attached to more than one Veda (e.g., theKatha, attached to Black Yajur, Sama, and Atharva; the Kena, attached to bothSama and Atharva; Muller, [1879–1884] 1962: 1:xci; 2:xxi). This implies that atsome period the schools competed over possession of this new high-prestige intellectualproperty.29. The Manu Smriti collected earlier ritual duties and prohibitions, beginning after200 b.c.e., reaching its final form about 100 c.e. The Yajñavalkya Smriti shows amore systematic treatment of law, ca. 100–200 c.e. Its attribution to the sageimplies that the Upanishads were being taken into Brahmanical orthodoxy at thistime. Still other rival law books were created around this time by the Vishnu sectand others. There was an outpouring of law texts in the medieval period, 700–1200, when Hinduism definitively triumphed over Buddhism (Basham, 1989:101–103). Manu became regarded as the definitive book of Hindu caste law onlyduring the British Empire in the 1800s; before that time other works were morewidely used in Hindu legal circles (Doniger, 1991: lx–lxi).Notes to Pages 206–209 • 96530. Manu Smriti 2:3. In contrast, ca. 150 b.c.e. Panini’s grammar (4:6) had merelydefined nastika as a non-believer in the other world, excluding only the materialistelement philosophers.31. The Ramayana depicts the Buddhists in the guise of demons inhabiting Sri Lanka,who are defeated by an expedition to the island, headed by a warrior-hero who isidentified with one of the gods of the Hindu pantheon.32. See the accounts of Lamotte (1958: 571–606); Conze (1962: 119, 123, 195);Hirakawa (1990: 110–118); Raju (1985: 147, 154–156); Nakamura (1980); Dutt(1962).33. Theological issues are those of concern only to believers in particular religioustenets; these may be highly particularistic, such as the name and distinctive identityof God, or local traditions of stories, rituals, and memberships; for instance, theChristian dispute over the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary, or Hinduarguments over the relative standing of Shiva or Vishnu. Theological issues mayalso develop more abstract questions, such as the relations among the Trinity, orthe existence of cosmic bodies of the Buddha. Philosophical issues are those which,although they may arise in a theological context, are potentially detachable fromit and of interest to a wider range of argument. Many issues entwine betweentheology and philosophy; this is one reason why theological controversies give riseto philosophy, even if the theologians are opposed to it, as was the case in earlyBuddhism, Christianity, and Islam alike.34. Hirakawa (1990: 302–303). Mahayana emerged at the same time (100 b.c.e.–100c.e.) that scribes were taking the place of the oral reciters who specialized inmemorizing particular classes of texts (Dutt, 1962: 30, 149).35. Willis (1979: 52–53). There seem to have been two Vasubandhus, the Yogacara inthe mid-300s (designated Vasubandhu I), and the Sarvastivadin a century later(Vasubandhu II). This interpretation is supported by Frauwallner (1953–56), Dutt(1962: 270, 281–282), Potter (1976), and Nakamura (1980: 109), although thetraditional identification of the two is maintained by some scholars.36. Conze (1962: 166–171); Nakamura (1980: 129); Guenther (1972: 59, 132). Athousand years later, a similar inflation of enlightenment took place in the Zenschool in its late scholasticizing phase in Japan.37. Cut off from these developments in the north was a flurry of Buddhist philosophyin Sri Lanka in the mid-400s, where Buddhaghosa combined all the schools intoa Theravada master text (Conze, 1962: 203; Kalupahana, 1992: 206–216). It wasa syncretism characteristic of defensive periods, at a time when Buddhism wasclosing down in south India. Its survivors migrated to Sri Lanka, where the kingfought off a Tamil invasion from the mainland.38. Old geopolitical bases reappeared in the newer religious-intellectual rivalries.Mithila was apparently in old Videha, the rival of the Magadha capital in the timeof the Buddha and Mahavira (OHI, 1981:77).39. The Samkhya-sutras, however, were not manufactured until around 1400, duringthe period when the “six darshanas” rubric was adopted among orthodox Hindus(EIP, 1987: 327).40. A brief guide to this entire period appears in Chapter 15 under the heading “The966 • Notes to Pages 211–228Indian Sequence” (pages 818–826). There is no overall narrative history of Indianphilosophy as a sequence of ongoing arguments; most histories segregate Buddhistand Hindu developments from each other, and within each camp divide the expositionamong separate schools as isolated rubrics. The volumes of the Encyclopediaof Indian Philosophy (EIP) provide corrective material at a high level of detail;and partial sketches of overall dynamics and interactions among the schools existin Stcherbatsky’s (1962) and Frauwallner’s (1953–1956) classic works; see alsoRubin (1954). A recent exception is Phillips (1995), which concentrates primarilyon the interaction between Nyaya and Advaita.41. These included lengthy classifications of fallacies, which the Greeks tended toignore; that is to say, the Indians treated logic as the science of argument ratherthan the study of valid inference. See Potter, (1976: 56–92); Stcherbatsky (1962);EIP (1977); on the development of Indian logic and its conflictual interaction withBuddhist logicians, see Shastri (1976); and generally Matilal (1986, 1990).42. In this ecumenical mood Bhartrihari interpreted the Vedic aum as identical to theMadhyamika shunyata; in the succeeding generations, Bhavaviveka (500s) andChandrakirti (600s) accepted Hinduism as propaedeutic to Buddhism (Halbfass,1991: 66). Grammar became among the most intersectarian of disciplines. Bhartrihari’sgrammar was commented upon by the Yogacarin Dharmapala, the headmonk of Nalanda, in the 500s.43. The details of Bhartrihari’s argument are connected with discussions by his grandteacherVasubandhu about the nature of time in the Buddhist Abhidharma (EIP,1990: 41–44, and Potter, 1976: 130–134) as well as with issues then debatedbetween the rival Hindu substance philosophies Samkhya and Vaisheshika.44. Dignaga’s doctrine is something like Saussure’s structuralist theory of language, inwhich words take their meaning not by indicating instances but by markingdifferences from one another. As the later commentator Dharmottara (700s) putsit: pure sensation is all that exists; thought makes it definite by negation; negationis the essence of thought, not of reality (Stcherbatsky, 1962: 1:536).45. Dignaga here expresses the equivalent of the position of Duns Scotus and Williamof Ockham that God—the ideal condition of knowledge—perceives everything inits radical particularity, its haecceitas, without the distorting lens of universals.46. EIP (1987: 4); an early version was known simply as the “sixty topics.” A rathersimilar activity is implied in the name of the Vaisheshika, which originally seemsto have meant “those who make distinctions” (Halbfass, 1992: 272–273). Samkhyalists paralleled in many details the Buddhist Abhidharma. Samkhya as thephilosophy of “enumeration” seems to have made its turf the coordination ofvarious lists of this sort, setting up parallels, and deriving further categories frommore basic generative ones. Later lists were created by cross-classifying, resultingin mega-systems of 28 or 50 items or more.47. Purusha is the older concept. In the Rigveda it is the primal Man from whose bodythe universe was divided; in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, it is identified withatman, which divides itself into man and woman, from whose copulation werecreated the living species. Prakriti, material nature, is eventually identified with thefemale side, while Purusha becomes a plurality of individual soul substances. InNotes to Pages 229–234 • 967the tantric Yoga cult that became popular after 800 c.e., the naked woman whocopulates with the yogi (in inner visualization or in the flesh) is regarded as anincarnation of Prakriti (Eliade, 1969: 259).48. The Yoga-sutras, compiled around 500 c.e., differed from previous sutra collectionson meditative practice by incorporating an explicit metaphysics from Samkhya,and by adding Hindu theism. Classic Samkhya culminating in Ishvarakrishnawas atheistic, following the tendency toward a naturalistic cosmology which comesfrom raising the level of abstraction on a mythological tradition of anthropomorphicworld elements. The Yoga-Samkhya combination heightened the Hindu identityof both positions. Before this time, Yoga meditation was more typicallyidentified with Buddhism; the Yogacara school simply meant “those who meditate.”Philosophical intellectuals looked down on this rather eclectic Hindu syncretism.Yoga is not counted as one of the “six darshanas” by Haribhadra in the700s; by the time it gets standard mention (around 1400), it is usually lumpedin a rubric of positions that are no longer intellectually alive. Shankara in the700s considered Yoga meditation beneficial mainly for “persons of slower understanding,”and regarded its plurality of souls, and its progression through whichthe meditator rises from matter to atman, as obstacles to understanding the truenon-dualist reality (Halbfass, 1991: 226).49. It is worth stressing, insofar as the image of Indian philosophy is so heavily coloredretrospectively by the later dominance of Advaita, that all five darshanas thatexisted before 700 c.e. were at least partially materialist, and included senseperception among the valid sources of knowledge.50. EIP (1981: 15–16, 177, 346). As usual there is debate over the authenticity ofthese connections. I follow Potter (EIP, 1981) in dating Shankara in the early 700srather than the traditional 788–820. See also Wood (1990: 38, 47); Isayeva (1993:83–87).51. Gaudapada’s famous commentary was on one of the most Buddhist-influencedUpanishads, the Mandukya (ca. 200 c.e.). This Upanishad was also devoted tothe cult of the mantra aum, which we have seen Bhartrihari advocating acrossBuddhist-Hindu lines a few generations earlier. In his commentary on this text,Shankara blatantly inserted the terminology of Brahmanistic Vedanta (Isayeva,1993: 61). On the composite nature of the Gaudapadiya-Karika and its relationshipto Buddhism, see King (1995).52. Halbfass (1991: 301–310). The complexities of how a sacrifice could bring aboutits consequences became a fertile ground for debate among the Naiyayikas, fromUddyotakara in the 500s to Jayanta in the 800s. They raised issues such as howa sacrifice gave merit to the sponsor who merely paid the Brahmans to carry itout, or how deficiencies in the karma of the sacrificer could offset the potency ofthe ritual.53. After Prabhakara’s Mimamsa had disappeared as an active school, this structuralconflict was repeated 400 years later: Prabhakara’s extreme epistemological realismwas reappropriated by Ramanuja as part of the differentiation of Advaita intellectualspace.54. For Shankara, the self cannot observe itself, just as “even hot fire cannot burn968 • Notes to Pages 237–246itself, and even the most able actor cannot climb on his own shoulder” (Brahmasutra-bhasya 3.3.54). Shankara also takes over Prabhakara’s argument for theself-validity of knowledge, while transferring its conclusion from the empiricalworld to the self, which is in the nature of the case not delimited by any of theconcepts which apply to objects. In addition, Shankara cuts short any infiniteregress of consciousness observing consciousness, since its knowledge is immediatelyself-revealing (Isayeva, 1993: 126, 184–185).55. For instance, in opposing the Mimamsa doctrine of karmic action through ritual,Shankara defends salvation by insight alone, which was the mark of the Madhyamikaschool. Shankara engages in his lengthiest polemics with the Yogacaraschool (Isayeva, 1993: 172). This is in keeping with the sociological principle thatconflict is most intense when it occurs over close identities (Coser, 1956: 67–71).56. Shankara’s disciple Sureshvara formulated the argument: “No doubts can arise inrelation to the Self, since its nature is pure immediate consciousness” (Deutsch,1969: 19).57. Orthodox scholars count between 10 and 14 Upanishads as fundamental, out ofthe hundred created by this time. Shankara established 11 as classic by citing themin his commentary on the Brahma-sutras, and wrote commentaries on 10 of them(EIP, 1981; Nakamura, 1973: 77–79). Badarayana had referred to 6 of these;Gaudapada’s Advaita commentary had publicized yet another Upanishad, theBuddhist-influenced Mandukya, which Shankara (if his surviving commentary isauthentic) added to the canon.58. Shankara’s home math at Sringeri in south India was probably founded on the siteof a Buddhist monastery (Eliot, 1988: 209–211).59. Basham (1951: 284). Time is the only unextended substance the Jainas recognize,and that too is a substance. On Jaina philosophy generally, see Raju (1985:106–123); Potter (1976: 115, 145–149).60. Although Buddhist texts disappeared from India as Hindu triumphed, Sanskrittexts by Shantarakshita and Kamalashila were preserved in Jaina collections,further testifying to the cosmopolitanism and the marginality of Jaina observers inthis period (Dutt, 1962: 239).61. Nakamura (1980: 309–311, 332–341); Stein (1972: 72–74, 165, 224); Dutt (1962:350–351). Prominent sexual-yogic tantrists in the 800s included the Bengal kingIndrabuddhi and his sister.62. The Shaiva movement became philosophically creative when it came into contactwith a long-standing network of Nyaya logicians in the midst of declining Buddhismin Kashmir. The Shaivas’ mythology of their god of death and destructionwas the ideological counterpart of their practices of overturning orthodox Hindutaboos through ritual orgiasticism and even violence. The Shaiva order brandedtheir bodies with the mark of a phallus, inhabited charnel yards, carried skulls,and daubed their bodies with ashes. Theirs was the charisma of emotional shock;nevertheless it entered the field of intellectual argument when Shaivas began toconvert the Nyaya and Buddhist logicians. The emotion-centered mythology wasrationalized into a cosmology in which the universe is composed not of consciousness,substance, or even nothingness but of the energy of creation and destruction.Notes to Pages 248–259 • 969Contacts and debates with Advaitins resulted in identifying the pan-energy cultwith metaphysical monism. A variant on this position, Shaktism, identified thisenergy with metaphysical potentiality (Pandey, 1986; Eliot, 1988: 2:211–222;Muller-Ortega, 1989). The internal debates of this network cannot be followedhere. Leading thinkers were in a network from about 900 to early 1000s c.e.passing from Utpala to Abhinavagupta and Shri Kantha, including the minorfigures listed as 137–134, 161–165, and 185–189 in the key to Figures 5.4 and5.5, but not depicted in these network diagrams.63. The story goes that Udayana defeated Shri Harsha’s father in a public debate; theson exacted revenge (Phillips, 1995: 75).64. Shri Harsha was in Bengal, and thus in the sphere of whatever Buddhist networkssurvived in India during these generations of Buddhism’s death.65. Potter (1976: 181); Halbfass (1992: 235). A Buddhist philosopher ca. 1090,Ratnakirti, had also taken the step of refuting the existence of other minds.Culminating earlier debates of Advaitas and Buddhists, which seem to have treatedany solipsistic conclusion as a reductio ad absurdum, Ratnakirti let the argumentfor solipsism stand on its own merits. The Buddhist criterion of being—Dignaga’sstandard, that which is causally effective—underlies all other conceptions of being;the resulting primacy of momentariness further entails the non-existence of otherminds and other experiences (Halbfass, 1992: 24; Nakamura, 1980: 310). Ratnakirti,coming as the very last gasp of Buddhist thought in India, was an isolateindeed; his boldness gained him no following among the unphilosophical tantristsof his own camp, and his reputation was swallowed up in the Hindu tide. Thesame matrix of argument, in the following generations would lead again to anextreme with Chitsukha.66. The sect claimed a succession of at least three previous leaders, including thephilosopher Yamunacharya, a relative of Ramanuja’s father. Ramanuja codifiedthe rituals and hymns of prior south Indian poet-saints, while bringing the lineageonto philosophical turf by providing a comprehensive theology. Ramanuja was thegreat organizer, founding some 700 maths and establishing monastic rules. UnlikeBuddhists and Shaivites, Ramanuja monks were allowed to marry, and abbotshipswere hereditary, a feature which was imitated by several other Vaishnava sects,and which no doubt added property interests to sectarian barriers and hostilities(Eliot, 1988: 2:231–237, 316; Dasgupta, 1922–1955: 3:63–165).67. Phillips (1995: 145) regards Ragunatha’s Neo-Nyaya as similar to the ontology ofDavid Armstrong. See also Potter (1976: 122); Phillips (1995: 142–144).68. Gangesha, the creative founder of Neo-Nyaya, acquired a reputation as impenetrablyscholastic; for example, in his major work he considers the merits and defectsof 35 definitions of veridicality (Phillips, 1995: 130).69. Phillips (1995: 145) argues that Neo-Nyaya is an unrecognized contribution thatwill eventually become part of the forefront of world philosophy: “It is inevitablethat on-going work in [Western] ontology embrace eventually the Nyaya-Vaisesikatradition, i.e. when its most astute contributors, Raghunatha, Jagadisa, and Gadadhara,have been recognized by the broad philosophical community [of the future]as the great philosophers they are.”970 • Notes to Pages 261–26970. See 251–253 in the key to Figure 5.5; and Raju (1985: 61).71. Potter (1976: 252–254). This pattern is particularly prominent in modern thinkerssuch as Ramakrishna who represent India to the West.6. Buddhist and Neo-Confucian China1. At the end of the Northern Wei (about 534 c.e.) there were 2 million monks andnuns, and 30,000 temples. The size of the Buddhist church fluctuated widely duringbattles for political favor with Taoists and Confucians. In 574–577, the NorthernChou emperor, at the instigation of Taoist advisers, confiscated the property of theBuddhist temples and returned as many as 3 million monks to lay life. Afterreunification, the Sui emperor in 601 drastically curtailed the Confucian schoolsand promoted Buddhism; during his reign 230,000 monks and nuns were converted.In the mid-T’ang dynasty (713–741), a time of violent shifts in the politicalpopularity of Buddhism, there were 125,000 monks and nuns; in 830 as many as700,000 monks were officially registered. In the great persecution of 845 the censusindicated 260,000 monks and nuns to be returned to secular life, 4,600 monasteriesand 40,000 temples and shrines destroyed, and several million acres of fertile landsconfiscated. Even these numbers do not indicate the full extent of Buddhism; theydo not include novice monks, who may have been far more numerous than thefully ordained monks. In addition, the monasteries at this time possessed 150,000slaves, who were turned into tax-paying peasants. Data from Ch’en (1964: 136,155, 158, 190–191, 200–201, 204, 232, 242, 244, 250–251, 259, 401). OnChinese population growth, see McEvedy and Jones (1978).

Loyang in the east and Ch’ang-an (Sian) in the west were the two great capitalcities of northern China; the seat of government often changed between them, whilethe other remained the secondary capital.4. In fact, the Yogacara doctrine of Consciousness-Only had already been in existencein China, previously imported from India by Paramartha around 550; Hsüan-tsanghimself had studied with these masters before going to Nalanda. Chinese intellectualsdid not fail to understand these doctrines; the school had survived alreadyfor three generations. And the Hua-yen philosophy that displaced Consciousness-Only was fully as abstract and technical.5. Hsüan-tsang’s travels to India became the subject of the most popular novel ofmedieval China, Journey to the West (or Monkey). It is a comic fairy tale ofsupernatural demons and protectors, featuring the monkey with magic powers whoaccompanies Hsüan-tsang. The basket of scriptures which is the object of the tripis a kind of magical precious object; there is no sense that it has intellectualcontents. This reflects the way Hsüan-tsang was received by the emperor and theNotes to Pages 269–288 • 971populace when he returned to Ch’ang-an. Earlier, the translator Kumarajiva wasreputed to be a great magician, and was even forced to mate with court concubinesto propagate his magic powers.6. Gregory (1991); Weinstein (1987: 63, 149); Dumoulin (1988: 45–49, 225–235,284–285). The influence of Hua-yen within the Ch’an lineages is noted in Figures6.3 and 6.4 from the time of the great innovators Shih-t’ou and Ma-tzu, ca. 750,down to Ta-hui, ca. 1150.7. In Figure 6.3 we see the Ch’an lineages already starting to split at the time ofHung-jen’s contemporary Fa-jung (238), the alleged founder of the Oxhead school,who syncretized Ch’an meditation with the old Three Treatise school. Obviouslythere was no strong anti-intellectualism here, but the splitting was a structuralharbinger of things to come. The most prominent Oxhead master was Hung-jen’spupil Fa-chih (240), who combined meditation with the Amidaist practice ofinvoking the name of the Buddha. The Oxhead school lasted through sevengenerations of masters, although it never had any of the famous “Zen”-styleparadoxers (McRae, 1985; 1986: 241–242). Hung-jen’s pupils included three morewho originated their own lineages: the “Northern school” patriarch Shen-hsiu; hisrival Hui-Neng; and Hsuan-Chih (240a), who founded a Szechuan school whichpracticed meditation on the Buddha’s name, another syncretism of Ch’an with thePure Land school. Hui-Neng in turn was not only master of the contentiousShen-Hui but propagator of several other lineages as well, including those of the“Zen” radicals Ma-tzu and Shih-t’ou. It is apparent that Hui-Neng did not makean isolated doctrinal breakthrough, but was in the midst of an organizationaltransformation as Ch’an lineages split off all around him.8. Consciousness-Only, with its great intellectual difficulty, was highly elitist; the routeto enlightenment culminated in mastery of the philosophy, with the highest religiousstatus reserved for advanced scholars. T’ien-t’ai had already made a similarclaim, with its hierarchy of doctrines to be mastered before enlightenment. At theopposite end of the field, the Pure Land sects made salvation as easy as possible,with the Amidaists taking it to the extreme of demanding only chanting a holyname. In the mid- and late 700s this conflict became explicit, as T’ien-t’ai and PureLand monks polemicized between intellectual and anti-intellectual, hard and easyroutes to peak religious status. Hui-neng himself was subject of polemical attackby Tzu-min (268 in Figure 6.3) of the Pure Land school; and Tzu-min is a lineagepredecessor of Fa-chao (271), who preached the prospect of damnation in hell andcondemned the easy paths to enlightenment, including universal salvation. TheCh’an route, however, was at neither of the two Pure Land poles, which appliedessentially to laypeople, and differed over the rigorousness of faith required. TheCh’an innovation concerned the restrictedness or availability of high religiousstatus among the elite of meditation specialists.9. We see this clearly by comparing Figures 6.3 and 6.4: in the former the Ch’anlineages fan out across the page, taking the place of all other Buddhist factions; inthe latter, from 900 through 1200, we see the Ch’an lineages winnowing down,the surviving branches amalgamating with one another and finally disappearing,while the neo-Confucians fan out across their side of intellectual space.972 • Notes to Pages 290–29610. This effort to rewrite the Confucian lineage is reminiscent of Shen-hui’s claims foran esoteric lineage which were announced at the time of the Zen revolution 60years earlier, and might have been inspired by it. Hartman (1986) points outparallels between Ch’an and the philosophy of Han Yü’s ku wen movement; bothmovements were challenges to the state-supported popular Buddhism of the capital.Late in life Han Yü was friendly with a monk from Shih-tou’s Ch’an lineage(275a in Figure 6.3). On Li Ao, see Barrett (1992).11. “Han Yü’s bold equation of wen and tao, which is perhaps related to his philosophicalequation of thought and action, constituted a dramatic lift for the statusand role of literature in a Confucian society. It demanded for the writer a positionon par with the administrator. Artistically valid literary expression was no longera polite accoutrement of the civil servant but rather became a basic requisite forgreat political success” (Hartman, 1986: 14). Han Yü himself had repeatedly failedthe examinations under the older system.12. It is only at this point that Chou Tun-I was retrospectively made a founder ofNeo-Confucianism, although his ideas had been seeping among the Ch’eng disciplesafter the Shao lineage disappeared around 1130 (Graham, 1958: xix, 168).At the same time, Chang Tsai’s system, based on the Supreme Void, lost influenceto the Ch’eng focus on principle. Chu Hsi rewrote the earlier history of thesemovements, obscuring the central formative influence of the Ch’engs by ascribingthe origins to Chou Tun-I; whereas Chou was not a militant Neo-Confucian buta Confucian-Taoist syncretist who added only the Supreme Ultimate to his system.13. Plato’s idealism, centered on mathematics, emerged within the first seven generationsof the Greek intellectual community, and his immediate successors took it inthe direction of a rather particularized religion of star worship. But Plato himselfexplored a variety of positions, and what became known as “Platonism” did notsettle into a pervasively religious idealism until the Roman period; in the interim,the Academy was predominantly in the skeptical camp. For India, it is conventionalto interpret the philosophy of the Upanishads as idealist; in Chapter 5 I arguedthat this tendency has been exaggerated.14. In fact, Ch’an paralleled Hua-Yen as a highly reflexive philosophical consciousness,but the Neo-Confucians were building from too concrete a level to see this. WhatCh’an cultural capital could produce in abstract philosophy was demonstrated invirtually the same generation (the early 1200s) in Japanese Zen with Dogen’ssystem. Figure 7.2 in Chapter 7 shows that Dogen was both a direct and indirectpupil of Chinese Ch’an networks, and also a great-grandpupil of Chu Hsi.7. Japan1. As before, philosophers are divided into major (listed in all capitals), secondary(listed by name), and minor (listed by number in the key to Figures 7.1 through7.5). Criterion for ranking is the relative amount of space devoted to them in acombination of sources (EP, 1967; Piovesana, 1963; Kitagawa, 1987, 1990; Dumoulin,1990; Dilworth, 1989; Maruyama, 1974; Najita and Scheiner, 1978;Tsunoda, de Bary, and Keene, 1958; Totman, 1993; Akamatsu and Yampolsky,Notes to Pages 310–324 • 9731977; Harootunian, 1989; CHJ, 1988: chap. 14). Not listed are persons whoreceive less than a minimal amount of citation in these sources, who fail to appearin more than one source, or who receive only minor mention in these texts.(Additional sources used for network information are Najita, 1987; Nosco, 1990;Ooms, 1985; Bellah, 1957; Weinstein, 1977). It should be stressed that the criterionfor inclusion in this network is relative ranking in the attention space; the networkdoes not simply reproduce the lineage charts which were used as a mode oforganizational legitimation (and transfer of rights of office) in Chinese and JapaneseBuddhism, and which were imitated by the Neo-Confucian, Ancient Learning,and National Learning schools. Similarly, my criterion for network contact is notsimply listing in one of these official lineages as a pupil or successor; it is significantdirect personal contact (including written correspondence) between individuals,whether they are listed as doctrinal followers or not. As we see repeatedly throughoutthe world, innovation typically breaks off from within an established schoolof thought. Thus, Ogyu Sorai was a student at the Hayashi school of officialNeo-Confucianism, although he became its most vehement critic; Kamo Mabuchi,the promoter of National Learning, is linked by intermediaries of acquaintanceshipas well as pupilship to Sorai’s lineage of Ancient Learning. It is the same in theBuddhist period: Honen the Pure Land founder and Eisai the patriarch of JapaneseZen were taught by the same Tendai masters.2. Sources on Japanese institutional and historical development (Yamamura, 1990;McMullin, 1984; Anderson, 1974: 435–461; Kitagawa, 1990; Sansom, 1958,1961; Morris, 1964; Frédéric, 1972; Ikegami, 1995).3. Once again eminence arises from the center of the prior network. Saicho began bystudying with all the main Nara orders; in China his ordination came from Tao-sui(269 in Figure 6.2), a grandpupil of Chan-jan (267), who had revived the T’ien-taidoctrine during the mid-700s. Saicho, a typical importer, eclectically collected otherordination certificates, from Zen as well as Vinaya and mantra (tantric) masters.4. Kukai was ordained by a grandpupil of Amoghavajra (254 in Figure 6.2), aCeylonese tantrist who had been tutor and rainmaker to emperors.5. A popular saying of the Kamakura period went: “Tendai for the imperial court,Shingon for the nobility, Zen for the warriors, Pure Land for the common people”(Dumoulin, 1990: 31).6. This syncretism had already set in by the mid-900s, when the Zen master T’ien-taiTe-shao revived the old center on Mount T’ien-t’ai; among his pupils were TaoYüan, who edited the Zen chronicles, Record of the Transmission of the Lamp(1004, formulating a Zen orthodoxy), and Yung-ming Yen-shou, who compiled ahuge syncretist overview of all teachings, emphasizing compatibility between Zenand the sutras. In a parallel branch of the same lineage, Ch’i-sung (1007–1072)even incorporated Confucianism into Zen by composing a work on the classicDoctrine of the Mean.7. See Dumoulin (1990: 8–15, 54). Nonin’s pupils made contact with Te-kuang, adisciple of Ta-hui, of secondary stature in Figure 6.4, from the Lin-chi line. Thesepupils brought back a rich reliquary from China, including Ta-hui’s dharma robe,implying that the Chinese lineages encouraged the Japanese as continuers of a974 • Notes to Pages 326–333visibly dying tradition. Genealogical documents of lines of succession were preservedin monasteries as precious treasures.8. Eisai was already middle-aged. He had been to China 20 years earlier, at whichtime he had merely returned with Tendai texts; on his later trip he studied Zenand Vinaya as well. Upon his second return to Japan, Eisai founded the first Zenmonasteries, but he continued to be very compromising toward the establishedschools. His monasteries at first remained a branch of the Enryaku-ji on MountHiei; they continued to practice ceremonial, sutra reading, and Shingon, evendeveloping a version called tantric-magical Zen. Such eclecticism was nothing new.Eisai also brought back with him Neo-Confucianism from a very minor pupil ofChu Hsi. His visit coincided with a compromising mood in Chinese Zen, the heightof its contact with the Neo-Confucian networks (as we see in Figure 6.4).9. In all, 46 Rinzai lineages were founded in Japan, along with several other Zensects; the official Zen history included the lives of 1,600 important monks (Dumoulin,1990: 8, 36). These numbers far exceed the upper limits of the attentionspace; by the law of small numbers only a few lineages could become eminent. Itwas by building on a successful vector of attention that a small set of Rinzai andSoto lineages produced virtually all the famous masters, whose names appear asmajor and secondary figures in Figure 7.2 (as well as most of the names in the keyto that figure which meet the criterion of sufficient historical attention to be listedas “minor”).10. The tea master Murata Juko, in the late 1400s, created the famous Zen stonegarden of the Daitokuji in Kyoto. This monastery became a center for the teaceremony and for the most worldly aspect of Zen. Other outstanding Kyoto templerock gardens were built around 1500 by Soami, a samurai and government officialwho simultaneously excelled as poet, tea master, and ink painter (Kidder, 1985:222–236; Kitagawa, 1990: 126; Dumoulin, 1990: 20, 151–153, 248; Varley, 1977).11. “This is the great watershed, a point of demarcation in Japanese cultural historyremarkably similar to that in the West between the arts of the Renaissance andthose of Medieval Christianity from which they emerged” (Rosenfield, 1977: 207).12. The inflation of religious currency was also promoted in the interests of raisingmoney from the laity. One of the targets of Ikkyu’s scorn was the Zen abbot Doso,who raised money among the wealthy merchants “by granting certificates ofenlightenment to lay people who attended mass meditation sessions at which koanwere ‘solved’ by esoteric transmission rather than through rigorous self-directedmeditative enquiry” (Collcutt, 1990: 614).13. Collcutt (1990: 604–609, 613). The situation was similar to that which arose inT’ang and Sung China, when certificates of monastic ordination (as ordinarymonks, not as abbots) were sold in official revenue-raising campaigns; in the laterperiod these certificates came to circulate for private resale. In the Chinese case,these certificates became used as a paper currency, and were items of investmenton a speculative market (Ch’en, 1964: 241–244). The Sung dynasty economy wasprobably the world’s first breakthrough into full-scale market capitalism, outgrowingthe sector of monastic entrepreneurship which had pioneered rationalizedstructures of market production and reinvestment. In subsequent dynasties theNotes to Pages 333–342 • 975market was asphyxiated by governmental regulation, confined to local exchangeswhich never regained the dynamic of rationalized economic growth. When thisstructural complex was transferred to Japan through the Buddhist movements,market growth resumed. On the sociological model of the Chinese and JapaneseBuddhist economies (Collins, 1986: 58–73; and Collins, 1997). On Japanese economicgrowth (Hanley and Yamamura, 1977; Nakane and Oishi, 1990; Totman,1993; Nakai and McClain, 1991; Smith, 1959; Collcutt, 1981; McMullin, 1984;Yamamura, 1990.)14. “There is no satori. Your mind is the original Buddha. Is there anything lackingin the Buddha mind? Can one attain enlightenment from outside oneself?” “Evenwhen enlightenment is present, it is not good to simply stay with it, for the mostimportant thing comes afterwards,” (quoted in Dumoulin, 1990: 323).15. The full force of official establishment developed gradually. In 1640 an Office ofInquisition was established to check that families were registered with a temple; atfirst directed only against Christians, in 1661 its activities were extended to theentire population (McMullin, 1984: 243–245).16. Hakuin described his experience as follows: “Night and day I did not sleep; I forgotboth to eat and rest. Suddenly a great doubt manifested itself before me. It was asthough I was frozen solid in the midst of an ice sheet extending tens of thousandsof miles. A purity filled my breast and I could neither go forward nor retreat . . .Although I sat in the lecture hall and listened to the master’s lecture, it was asthough I were hearing a discussion from a distance outside the hall. At times it feltas though I were floating through the air . . . The state lasted for several days.Then I chanced to hear the sound of the temple bell and I was suddenly transformed.It was as if a sheet of ice had been smashed or a jade tower had fallenwith a crash” (Dumoulin, 1990: 370). Hakuin remained egotistically proud of hisexperience and was not awarded the dharma seal. Months later, while he wasbegging in a village, his mind filled by working on a koan, a peasant womanknocked him down with a broom. When he regained consciousness, he suddenlyfound that the koan had been solved, sending him into dancing, clapping, andshouts of laughter. This time his master recognized the experience as valid (Dumoulin,1990: 372).17. Dumoulin (1990: 157 186, 194, 204, 331). Bankei Yotaku in 1647, after two yearsof extreme asceticism had left him close to death, experienced his own sickness asthe shock of realization: “So I was ready to die, and at the time I felt no remorse.There was nothing special left for me. My only thought was that I was going todie without fulfilling my long-nourished desire. Then I felt a strange sensation inmy throat. I spat against a wall. A mass of black phlegm, large as a soapberry,rolled down the side . . . Suddenly just at that instant . . . I realized what it wasthat had escaped me until now” (quoted in Dumoulin, 1990: 312).18. “One night during zazen practice the boundary between before and after suddenlydisappeared . . . It was as if I had arrived at the ground of the Great Death, withno memory of the existence of anything, not even of myself. All I remember is anenergy in my body that spread out over ten times ten-thousand worlds and a lightthat radiated endlessly . . . I forgot that my hands were moving in the air and my976 • Notes to Pages 343–345feet were dancing” (Dumoulin, 1990: 408). The account is from a Zen master ofthe mid-1800s.19. Preston’s (1988) ethnography of a Zen meditation center concludes that the Zenexperience is socially constructed by the focused setting and rituals of inwardattention. What is constructed, however, is not a particular “culture” but anattitude set free from the contents of verbal cultures. The rituals of Zen practiceare, so to speak, counter-rituals, which de-reify and disenchant the objects ofordinary social life. Buddhism recognizes a deep version of the social constructionof reality; the institutions and paramount realities of the ordinary world (samsara)are mere “name and form.” The path pursued by Zen is not to escape into anotherrealm but to transform into another key; instead of living focused on cognitiveconstructions, to live focused on the flow of wordless practices.20. Kitagawa (1990: 143). Ooms (1985) points out that the shogun was more interestedin promoting a cult, centered on the lavishly baroque Tokugawa mausoleumat Nikko, which elevated Ieyasu personally into a reincarnation of the nationaldeity, the sun goddess Amaterasu. This cult, promoted vigorously in the 1640s,was no great success against the better-organized religious and educational institutions;indeed, Ieyasu had to rely on the Tendai abbott Tenkai to work out thetheological justification of the reincarnation doctrine. Razan’s hostility to Buddhismwas not a general propensity of the Tokugawas, but rather a stance in thestruggle among intellectuals, which did not shift decisively in an anti-Buddhistdirection until the opening of the successful proprietary schools in the 1660s.21. Takuan was the teacher of Hoshina Masayuki, Lord of Aizu, who became centralin the patronage network of the following generation (Ooms, 1985: 197). Takuanrepresents the height of fusion between samurai culture and Zen. Takuan wasfriendly with the shogun’s sword master, Yagyu Munenori, and was connected witha very famous swordsman, Miyamoto Musashi, author of A Book of Five Rings,on the spiritual dimension of combat. Takuan wrote for Munenori a text applyingBuddhist doctrine of non-attachment to the technique of the sword fight. Theconnection is not merely to show fearlessness in the face of death; it is to avoidclinging to one’s opponent’s movements or to the sword itself, to flow througheverything without distinction and without consciously directing one’s mind (Dumoulin,1990: 285–287; Kammer, 1969).22. Nakamura (1967); Dumoulin (1990: 341–344). It would be more accurate to saythat Suzuki integrated Buddhist subduing of the body into the spirit of samuraimilitary discipline, but universalistically, without caste distinctions among socialranks. Suzuki was close to official power and was given bakufu appointments,including restoration of provincial temple properties as a means of exerting controlover local samurai. He was entrusted with a mission to pacify the peasants aftera major provincial rebellion in 1637–1638 (Ooms, 1985: 123–139).23. The network of tea masters in Figure 7.3 originated at the shogun’s court in themid-1400s. The famous iconoclast Ikkyu Sojun, though not himself a tea master,connects this network with the religious elite, as teacher of Murata Shuko, a Zenmonk who returned to the world as a tea master. The several branches of thelineage culminate in the most famous of all, Sen no Rikyu, in the late 1500s. SenNotes to Pages 346–352 • 977no Rikyu became tea master to Hideyoshi, and the social arbiter of good taste inthe 1580s. The tea ceremony became a lavish display and a criterion of elitestanding; in 1587 a huge gathering of 800 devotees was held at Kyoto, at whichHideyoshi was upstaged by his tea master. Sen no Rikyu’s claims to status precedenceapparently provoked the dictator to demand in 1591 that he commit ritualsuicide (Dumoulin, 1990: 239–241; Varley, 1977).24. Sources on Tokugawa education (Rubinger, 1982; Dore, 1965; Totman, 1993:161–168, 301–302, 349–354, 429–435, 469–471; Passin, 1965; Najita, 1987).25. As Ikegami (1995) notes, Zen was not the source of the samurai ethos; samuraicodes went back to a distinctive warrior culture of the medieval period, and thesewere transformed during the Tokugawa under conditions of pacification into the“tamed” and refined manners which became anachronistic emblems of samuraiidentity. The networks of leading Zen and samurai masters overlapped at just thistime, because the underlying social bases of both career paths were crumblingsimultaneously.26. In 1682 came the first non-religious “best-seller,” Ihara Saikaku’s Life of anAmorous Man, a novel which was something of a cross between Defoe and theMemoirs of Casanova. This marks the point at which it became possible for awriter to support oneself purely off the market (Nosco, 1990: 27).27. Sources on Tokugawa intellectuals (EP, 1967; Maruyama, 1974; Piovesana,1963; Tsunoda, de Bary, and Keene, 1958; Totman, 1993; Sansom, 1963; Bellah,1957, 1978; Harootunian, 1970, 1988; Matsumoto, 1970; Najita and Scheiner,1978; Naita, 1987; Nosco, 1990; Ooms, 1985; Tucker, 1989; Wakabayashi, 1986;Koschmann, 1987; de Bary, 1979; Dilworth, 1979; CHJ, 1988: chap. 14).28. In a passage which shows the rising tide of rejection of both Zen and Zen-likemeditative practices prominent in religious Neo-Confucianism, Banzan declares:“My name is vacuity. How with this name can I make a pretense of learning andserve as a teacher of others?” (Maruyama, 1974: 42).29. De Bary (1979). Ansai’s declaration of loyalty—"If a person errs by studying ChuHsi, he errs with Chu Hsi. He has nothing to regret"—echoes the famous loyaltyof Shinran to his master during the founding of the Pure Land movements: “Eventhough, having been persuaded by Honen Shonin, I should go to Hell through theNembutsu, I should not regret it” (quoted in Maruyama, 1974: 37; Kitagawa,1990: 115).30. Shikoku is the large island south of the inland sea. The Neo-Confucian schoolthere had an independent beginning already in the mid-1500s with MinamimuraBaiken, supported by the local daimyo’s clan. Ansai went there to study followinghis Buddhist training at the old centers, at Mount Hiei and at a Rinzai temple inKyoto (Ooms, 1985: 199).31. Both were grandsons of Tokugawa Ieyasu, and held domains in the innermost circleof shogunal alliances.32. In other words, the samurai becomes a policeman, although Soko formulates thisas a more academic role: “The three classes of the common people make him theirteacher and respect him” (quoted in Tsunoda, de Bary, and Keene, 1958: 399).33. Soko’s pronouncements have an anti-Zen tone, which can be applied equally to978 • Notes to Pages 352–358the puritanism of Ansai’s sage religion: “Those who eliminate all human desiresare not human beings; they are no different from tiles and stones. Can we say thattiles and stones can comprehend the Principle of Heaven?” (quoted in Maruyama,1974: 46). In contrast, Ansai’s chief disciple, Sato Naokata, explicitly extolled Zenas the basis for discipline within government bureaucracy. Here we have a rivallegitimation for the same shift toward the peacetime samurai role which Soko wasconcerned with. Rival intellectual alliances approached the same issue with differentresources.34. Ito came from a branch of the lineage of Fujiwara Seika parallel and rival to Razan,via his teacher Matsunaga Sekigo. The Kogido initially took the form of a discussiongroup at Ito’s home, where his wealthy family entertained court nobles,doctors, Confucian scholars, poets, and painters. From this gathering developedregularly scheduled lectures with debates and grading (Rubinger, 1982: 50–51). Bythis route Ito became the first successful teacher from the merchant classes, breakinginto the samurai educational monopoly.35. Tetsugen was the most eminent member of the new Obaku Zen sect; he edited acomprehensive edition of the Buddhist scriptures of every sect, representing anequivalent on the Buddhist side of the tendency toward pure scholarship that wasbuilding up among the Confucians at this time, as well as the tendency to syncretismin a weakening movement.36. In Sorai’s words, the samurai class “lived like guests at an inn,” where “even asingle chopstick had to be paid for” (Maruyama, 1974: 132).37. At Sorai’s school, pupils were required to sign an agreement which includedthis clause, in regard to studying the laws of the Ming dynasty: “These laws arethe institutions of a different era and a different country. One must not simply employthem in the present era and destroy the existing laws” (quoted in Maruyama,1974: 97).38. Economics was emerging as a recognized discipline in the generation of the early1800s, explicitly known as keizai (Najita, 1987: 8). In 1815, following the workof Kaiho, another Kaitokudo product, Kusama Naokata, produced a history ofmoney, the central subject of economic controversy since the time of Arai Hakusekiand Sorai.39. Here Sorai was directly challenging the Bushido school of Yamaga Soko, whichdefended the action of the ronin. Oishi Kuranosuke, the leader of 47 ronin, wasa direct disciple of Yamaga Soko (Kitagawa, 1990: 159).40. “Although li seems to be the Ultimate Principle, it is not so. Since it is an abstractprinciple, it can be used in any way whatsoever. It is like being able to call a whitething black or any other color” (quoted in Maruyama, 1974: 146).41. During the crisis of the 1320s–1330s, when Go-Daigo tried to restore imperialrule, we find in Figure 7.2 the first significant Shinto branch of the intellectualnetwork. The leaders of the Watarai family, priests at the national Ise shrine,excluded Buddhist emblems from its precincts while emulating Buddhism by stressingmoral purity rather than merely ceremonial offerings for fertility and protectionmagic (Bellah, 1957: 65). The court intellectual Kitabatake Chikafusa now joinedthe Shinto cause, in part because of its usefulness in legitimating the Go-DaigoNotes to Pages 358–365 • 979restoration; at the same time, Chikafusa relied on Buddhist metaphysics to give alarger significance to the conception of Japan as a divine nation under the kami.It should be noted that this took place two generations after the rise of Nichiren’sHokke movement, which had made the same claim for Japan as the world’sBuddha-land. Again in the 1480s, when feudal combat in the aftermath of theOnin War destroyed any semblance of shogunal government, Kanetomo, a priestof the Yoshida shrine, promoted a syncretist Shinto which reversed previousrankings and made Buddhas and Boddhisatvas manifestations of the kami insteadof the other way around (Kitagawa, 1990: 160).42. Under Shingon auspices, the kami had been reduced to a dualism correspondingto Buddhist tantrism: matter and mind, male and female, dynamic and potentialaspects of things (Maruyama, 1974: 155). We are reminded here that Keichu, theadumbrator of National Learning, was a Shingon monk in the camp of Shintosupporters.43. The Shinto–National Learning movement was not the only religious reactionagainst (and split in the ranks of) the Sorai network. In 1729 (overlapping withthe height of Kada no Azumamaro’s activity), the Kyoto teacher Ishida Baiganfounded the Shingaku movement. It took an opposing position both to the Shintofundamentalists and to Sorai’s naturalist utilitarianism. Shingaku preached that thespiritual reality behind Buddhism, Neo-Confucianism, and Shinto were the same;its main practice, however, was meditation, not ceremonialism, thus putting itcloser to the Zen–sage religion tradition that was now disappearing from theupper-class intellectual space. Shingaku was preached successfully among the popularclasses, but using the vehicle of the educational marketplace rather than thetraditional evangelist. Baigan’s network connections shaped the direction of hisinnovation. He was the pupil of a lay teacher of the Obaku sect (i.e., the mostsyncretist of the Zen sects) as well as of a neo-Confucian; his early religious activitywas in the Ise-pilgrimage movement; and he formulated his distinctive doctrinesoon after engaging in argument with a disciple of Sorai. The term shingaku itselfhad been used by Sorai in his attack on Neo-Confucian philosophy (Bellah, 1978:139; 1957: 134–138).44. “What they call li is not something clearly fixed, it is not something readilycomprehensible to the human intellect. Hence a Confucian should define li in termsof the theories of the ancient Sages, and a Buddhist should do so by using thetheories of the Buddha . . . It is a Way based not on any objective criteria, butarbitrarily established by individuals” (quoted in Maruyama, 1974: 159).45. The schools devoted exclusively to Japanese studies (kokugaku) never reached massproportions. Only 9 such schools are known in the entire period before 1872,making up less than 1 percent of all proprietary schools. The vast majority (70percent) remained those with curricula of Chinese studies or calligraphy (Rubinger,1982: 13). The sheer number of schools, however, is not the source of intellectualmovement on the creative edge. Under the law of small numbers, the 200 shijuku(proprietary schools) founded during 1789–1829, and the additional 800 foundedduring 1830–1867, were outside the center of intellectual attention; they propa-980 • Notes to Pages 365–368gated older culture, and this period of mass expansion of schooling was not thetime when the main intellectual innovations took place.46. In France, the conservative monarchy following the 1815 restoration broke intofactions because of divergence between ultramontane Catholics and the administratorsof the state bureaucracy, especially over educational policy; the result wasa series of liberalizing and conservatizing swings leading up to the Orleanistrevolution of 1830. Again in 1860s, splits between Catholic traditionalists andstatist officials undermined conservative control; in this case the dominance of thesecularistic officials motivated the Catholics to join the anti-monarchist forces inpushing for liberalized rights (CMH, 1902–1911: 10:40–100; 11:295–297, 469–474).47. The first non-religious work was printed in Japan in 1591. Religious texts continuedto be major items on the market until 1680–1700 (Nosco, 1990: 26). Thiswas much the same time the transition occurred in European publishing.48. Tokyo University was founded in 1877 with European teachers. In 1893 chairswere opened to Japanese professors and the Europeans were gradually replaced.The same model developed elsewhere: Waseda University originated in 1882;Kyoto University, the second imperial foundation, was established 1897 (EP, 1967:252–253; Kitagawa, 1987: 305). Sources on post-Meiji intellectual life (EP, 1967;Kitagawa, 1987, 1990; Dilworth, 1989; Ketelaar, 1990; Najita and Scheiner, 1978;Tsunoda, de Bary, and Keene, 1958; Blacker, 1964; Gluck, 1985; Havens, 1970;Nishitani, 1982).49. See Chapter 8, Coda: “Are Idea Imports a Substitute for Creativity?”50. The attack on Christianity as an alien philosophy could be directed toward othercontemporary aims as well. Inouye Enryo, a True Pure Land priest, in 1887–1890attacked Christianity as irrational and irreconcilable with science; playing to theprestige of positivism, he argued that Buddhist religion is in greater harmony withrationality (Kitagawa, 1990: 230).51. In other words, the network connection comes first. It was apparently via Suzukithat Zen’s appeal to the philosophical networks of the West came home to Nishidaand stimulated his own creativity.52. The central experience consists in “acts of consciousness,” which are also the“place of nothingness,” and the “historically formative act” (quoted in Dilworth,1989: 149). Paralleling Buddhist dialectics is the puzzle in Aristotelean logic ofhow the individual can be reached by specification of the universal; a principiumindividuationis, Nishida suggests, points beyond itself to the ultimate emptiness ofthe things of conventional experience. A further resource is Kant’s unity of transcendentalapperception, which Nishida takes as referring to a place where subjectand object are united (Nishitani, 1982; xxxi). Nishida synthesizes a selection ofWestern concepts with a position rather like that of Nagarjuna and Dharmakirti:there is neither God/transcendence beyond phenomena nor substance to the phenomenathemselves. Samsara is sunyata; the world is ultimate reality, as Emptiness.53. In the 1890s Nakae Chomin attempted to revive Sorai’s naturalism as the explicitJapanese counterpart of Bentham’s Utilitarianism (Najita, 1987: 35). ThereafterNotes to Pages 369–376 • 981the Kyoto school did not reign in Japanese philosophy without opposition. For aperiod in the 1920s there were some advocates of Marxism, but no indigenouscreativity came from this.8. Islam, Judaism, Christendom1. The strong ÀAbbasid caliphate lasted long enough so that the period of redactionof hadith was closed before Islam began to fragment politically. Similarly, Catholicand Greek Christianity established its canon during the height of the RomanEmpire, and its adoption as state religion allowed heterodox variants to be forciblyexcluded.2. The conflict between religious orthodoxy and independent intellectual concerns isone, but not the only, route to epistemology. Long-term processes in the developmentof epistemology and logic will be considered more fully in Chapter 15.3. One point of substantive difference that was argued, however, was the unity ofGod, upheld by the Muslim theologians against Zoroastrian and Manichaeandualists. Even here Muslim theologians were more interested in turning the argumentagainst anthropomorphists in their own ranks. A comparison with Chinaand India implies that multi-religious competition in itself does not lead to proofsof the existence and nature of God. See Chapter 15.4. It lacked only Muslim Spain, conquered between 711 and 759, which broke freein the name of the Umayyad caliphate, which had been overthrown by the ÀAbbasidsin the civil war of 744–750. General sources for Islamic political, religiousand social history (Hodgson, 1974; Lapidus, 1988; McEvedy, 1961; Humphreys1991).5. This account of philosophers and biographical data draws generally on numeroussources (Watt, 1973, 1985; Fakhry, 1983; Hodgson, 1974; Wolfson, 1976; Rescher,1964; de Boer, 1903; individual essays in DSB, 1981, and EP, 1967). I haveincluded scientists and mathematicians in the networks, since their pattern isintimately connected with that of the philosophers. The methodology of rankingphilosophers into major, secondary, and minor figures is the same as that used inChapter 2. Islamic philosophers are ranked according to the relative amount ofreference to them in the cited sources. Jewish philosophers are ranked in relationto one another, based on Sirat (1985); Husik (1969); Guttman (1933); Pines(1967); EP (1967). These histories are all recent and largely European; earlierhistorical accounts on which they draw include Ibn al-Nadim (ca. 990), al-Baqillani(1000), al-Baghdadi (1030), al-Ghazali (1090), al-Sharastani (1130), Maimonides(1190), and Ibn Khaldun (1380).6. Intellectual historians have tended to ascribe most kalamite positions to foreigninfluences (summarized in Wolfson, 1976: 58–79) and to downplay indigenouslines of development. The principal MuÀtazilite arguments, however, were formedbefore 830, and it was in the next two generations that most of the translation ofGreek texts took place. The early MuÀtazilites knew something of the categoriesof Aristotelean logic, which seem to have come from secondhand accounts of982 • Notes to Pages 389–398Greek philosophy then beginning to circulate (Fakhry, 1983: 8–9; Watt, 1973:154–155, 205, 249); but they turned the concepts of substance and accident intoa quite different direction through the dynamics of their own disputes. Democritus’atomism is mentioned in Aristotle’s refutation of it in the Physics; but a translationwas probably not available in the formative period of Arabic atomism. Mostimportant, MuÀtazilite atomism is far from Democritean or Epicurean; the durableand spatial physical atoms of the Greeks are not the time-instants of the MuÀtazilites.When the genuinely Greek-oriented falasifa (philosophers) did appear, theypolemicized against MuÀtazilite atomism (Peters, 1968: 144). Alternatively, Fakhry(1983: 33–34) suggests that this point-atomism came from Buddhist, Hindu, andJaina schools in India existing by 500 c.e.; he mentions an anonymous treatise,“Religious Beliefs of India,” circulated in Arabic by the late 700s, contemporarywith the MuÀtazilite founders. The Jainas, however, combined atomism with veryun-MuÀtazilite doctrines in which everything is a substance, including motion,action, and time. The Nyaya-Vaisesika school of the Hindus combines atomism ofmaterial things with the reality of universals, plus the substances of infinite spirit(atman) and infinite mind (manas). The Buddhist Sarvastivadins had a timeatomismwhich was closest to the MuÀtazilites, but held very un-Muslim doctrinesthat the self is an unreal void, that God does not exist, that past and future as wellas the cessation of existence all exist (Raju, 1985: 53, 121, 253–262). It is implausiblethat the Arabs would have extracted just the relevant aspects of atomism fromthese closely knit systems, even if they had access to these kinds of philosophicaltexts. Karl Potter (EIP, 1977: 17) concludes that there is little evidence of explicitEast-West borrowing of doctrines in either direction.7. In part MuÀtazilite political policy set in motion this course of events. Initially theMuÀtazilites were aggressive primarily toward the dualists rather than against thehadith faction; their alliance with the ÀAbbasids involved the suppression of theZoroastrian religion of the old Persian regime and its Manichaean offshoot, whichhad flourished in Mesopotamia and the Christian Mediterranean since the 200sc.e. (Hodgson, 1974: 1:385). This aspect of kalamite religious policy continued,even with the reversal of caliphal favor toward hadith; it appears that Zoroastriansmay have made up 20 percent of the population of Baghdad in al-MaÁmun’s time,but were down to perhaps 2 percent two generations later (Massignon, 1982: 241).The religious pluralism of the early Islamic Empire was closing down at the sametime that a conservative orthodoxy was taking control.8. MuÀtazilites still existed in the early 1100s (the last MuÀtazilite notable enough toappear in the Figure 8.3 key is 208), and their position was carried on by JewishKaraites even longer.9. From the late 700s there were already court astronomers and astrologers atBaghdad, including foreigners from India, Persia, and Central Asia (see 14 through18 and 32 through 36 in Figure 8.1).10. On the Nestorians and Jacobites, see Latourette (1975: 167–169, 282–283). TheNestorian headquarters was at Baghdad. Islam had acquired an empire not througha holy war to spread the faith, but because its effort to convert the Arabs hadNotes to Pages 403–404 • 983spilled over into border clashes with surrounding states; then it fell heir to ageopolitical vacuum owing to the mutually destructive wars of the Byzantine andPersian empires (Lapidus, 1988: 38–43). There was little effort initially to convertconquered peoples, and outside of Arabia, most Muslim cities had very largenon-Muslim populations. The reversal of this religious policy began to pick upstrength after 900.11. Jewish philosophers are ranked relative to one another, separate from the rankingof Muslim philosophers. Hence it is not implied that Saadia ben Joseph is of thesame order of importance in this intellectual field as his most dominant Muslimcontemporaries.12. I refer to him by his Latin name, Rhazes, to distinguish him from Fakhr al-Dinal-Razi (Fakhruddin Razi), who lived eight generations later.13. Rescher (1964). Aristotle’s had been a logic of classes, the Stoics’ a logic ofpropositions. The Baghdad school recovered these from Galen and from Aristoteleancommentaries and extended their scope. The nature of possibility wasdebated. Matta and al-Farabi developed conditional syllogisms; al-Farabi dealtwith general and particular predication and the quantification of predicates. Heand Yahia ibn-ÀAdi took up from Alexandrian logic the question of universals, andattempted to reduce Aristotle’s 10 categories to substance and various species ofaccidents.14. This was not necessarily due to al-AshÀari personally. There are indications thathis position was already laid out in the previous generation by al-Qalanisi (74 inFigure 8.1), a moderate rational theologian among the hadith literalists; during hislifetime he was as famous as al-AshÀari. The latter’s fame resulted from a retrospectivereinterpretation by his lineage two generations later of its own origins(Watt, 1973: 287–288, 311); by the time of al-Baqillani, there was a vehementpolemic against MuÀtazilites as well as against Christians and Jews, and al-AshÀari’spublic break with the MuÀtazilites made him an appropriate emblem of theirdistinctiveness. Once again we see that it is the lineage and its conflicts more thanthe individual which generates intellectual fame; and the structural crunch ofintellectual attention deprives credit from someone like al-Qalanisi while giving itto another like al-AshÀari.15. Wolfson (1976: 355–454; 1979). Davidson (1987) emphasizes that arguments forcreation based on the impossibility of traversing an infinity go back to the Christiancritic of Aristotle, John Philoponus, while arguments for God as the unmovedmover come from Aristotle. Philoponus was being cited by the Muslims by thetime of al-Farabi in the early 900s; in the mid-800s al-Kindi was making argumentsvery similar to those of Philoponus (Davidson, 1987: 92–95, 106). Yet the earlyMuÀtazilites’ proofs emerged a generation before this, and some of them (such asAbu-l-Hudhayl’s) are not obviously dependent on Philoponus; even those whichare similar may have come from the kalamites’ own discussions of divisibility andatomism. In any case, the issues did not become important for the Muslims out ofpassive imitation of the Greeks. Greek philosophy had been only marginallyconcerned with the existence of God in anything approaching a religious sense.Aristotle’s unmoved mover is unrelated to Providence, creation, or immortality.984 • Notes to Pages 407–413The Neoplatonists, who developed as a pagan rival to Christianity, eventuallyproduced a full-fledged religious conception of God; but since their synthesisincluded Aristoteleanism, the One is very unlike a creator or Providence. Philosophicalarguments over God finally became focused when the Neoplatonists hadto make their peace with victorious Christianity. The Patristic writers were contentwith the argument from design—the order of the world implies a creator—but asAverroës later said, this is an argument for laypeople, not one argued at the levelof formal philosophical consideration (Davidson, 1987: 219, 236). The moresophisticated level emerged with Proclus (mid-400s), the last gasp of the paganNeoplatonist school at Athens. He was the first to recognize that Aristotle’s proofof an unmoved mover from the motion of the spheres is not a proof of a cause ofthe existence of the spheres; Proclus added an argument that the existence of theheavens requires an eternal being to sustain their existence, and compiled 18 proofsfor the eternity of the world (Davidson, 1987: 51, 281–282). Proclus’ pupil wasAmmonius (304 in Figure 3.8), who abandoned Neoplatonism for Christianity; hewas the teacher of both Simplicius (306 in Figure 3.8) and John Philoponus.Simplicius was the first to take the impossibility of an infinite regress of causes asa proof of God (Davidson, 1987: 338). And Philoponus based his argumentsexplicitly on a refutation of Proclus (Contra Proclum); in converting to Christianity,he reconverted the cultural capital of his school into a reasoned philosophicaltheology which Christianity had previously lacked. With the ending of his lineage,however, Philoponus’ arguments were not taken up in Christian philosophy. Theysurvived largely because similar lines of argument emerged among Muslim theologians.Less particularistically, the ancient struggle between an anthropomorphicmonotheism and a defensive religion of philosophical syncretism (i.e., Christianityversus Neoplatonism) eventually brought about reasoned arguments over the fundamentalitems of the religious cosmology; and these arguments were picked upagain when another monotheistic anthropomorphism (Islam) developed its ownintellectual networks.16. Davidson (1987: 214–215, 309–310), however points out that Ibn Sina did notproduce a pure ontological proof, based on concepts alone, as Anselm did inEurope two generations later. Ibn Sina included reference to the fact that somethingexists. But he raised philosophical analysis toward the ontological level, althoughmost of the further development was to take place after his texts were transmittedinto Christian philosophy.17. As compared to Descartes, Ibn Sina did not lay stress on the existence of self inthe “cogito ergo sum,” but emphasized instead the modality of being which isthereby revealed.18. Ibn Sina is the high point of Islamic logic; he contributes a theory of categoricalpropositions involving quantification of the predicate; of hypothetical and disjunctivepropositions; of singular propositions; and a theory of definition and classification(Rescher, 1964: 154–155). A rather sterile debate between proponents of IbnSina’s “eastern” logic and the “western” logic of the Baghdad and Cairo schoolssupplied what focus of attention there was within intellectual life from the mid-1100s down through the mid-1300s.Notes to Pages 414–423 • 98519. In the key to Figures 8.2 and 8.3, 196 in Afghanistan, 207 in Transoxiana, 217 inAnatolia, 229 in Baghdad, 232 in North Africa, 235 in Khwarazm–Oxus Rivervalley, 246 and 275 in India, Rumi’s order of darvish dancers in Anatolia, 255 inEgypt, 276 among the Anatolian lower classes, 277 in Persia, 294 in Iran andcentral Asia.

After writing the Muqaddimah, Ibn Khaldun migrated to Egypt and finished lifeas a Malikite judge. Figure 8.3 shows that Egypt too had had no significantintellectual life at this point for several generations.21. In fact, al-Kindi’s protégé Ibn HaÀimah (60 in Figure 8.1) translated Plotinus as“Theology of Aristotle.” Plotinus himself was not translated by name, and wasvery seldom mentioned (Fakhry, 1983: 20).22. Similarly, in Christian Europe, the translations of Aristotle which were madedirectly from the Greek by James of Venice and others in the mid-1100s wereinterpreted within the Neoplatonic framework. Slightly later in the century, Gerardof Cremona, translating Arabic texts in Toledo, translated not only Aristotle butalso Proclus’ Elements of Theology—the arch-Neoplatonic system—as the Liberde Causis, which also was attributed to Aristotle. The so-called “Theology ofAristotle” was also translated from the Arabic at this time. Europeans could seeno difference between Aristotle and Plotinus, since they were apparently unawareof the latter until Ficino translated the Enneads in 1492 (DSB, 1981: 1:270–273;11:42; Weinberg, 1964: 10–11, 95, 100).23. Sources on Jewish philosophy generally (Sirat, 1985; Husik, 1969; Guttman, 1933;Wolfson, 1979; Pines, 1967, and individual articles in EP, 1967, and DSB, 1981).24. Only rabbinical writings were in Hebrew. Thus Maimonides produced his rabbinicalcode in Hebrew, but his Guide for the Perplexed, a philosophical reconciliationwith religion, was written in Arabic but using Hebrew characters, a kind of codefor members combining the cosmopolitan and the ethnic religious communities.Bahya ibn Paquda, among others, also wrote in this way, in Arabic with Hebrewcharacters (Pelaez del Rosal, 1985: 106). Even the nationalist anti-cosmopolitansamong the Jews, such as Judah Halevi, wrote in Arabic. Arabic was the languageof the Jewish intellectual community, and even the critics of that community usedit. The only philosophers who wrote in Hebrew before 1200 were Bar Hiyya andAbraham Ibn Ezra; both were in the Christian orbit, the former in Barcelona, whilethe latter traveled in Italy, France, and England (Sirat, 1985: ix; Hodgson, 1974:1:357, 452, 468–469). Sources for this period generally (Husik, 1969; Sirat, 1985;Pelaez de Rosal, 1985; Cruz Hernandez, 1957).25. This is the network of Jewish poets and grammarians (beginning with 2 and 3 inFigure 8.4) which was prominent at Córdoba down through 1100, and whichbranched off to form the great Jewish rabbinical academy at Lucena (30 milesfrom Córdoba), connecting to Ibn Zaddik, Judah Halevi, Abraham Ibn Ezra,and Maimonides. The early Spanish Muslim scientists were virtually all at Córdoba;we may note especially al-Majriti (9 in Figure 8.4), who apparently traveledin the east before 1000 and not only returned with astronomy and geometry,but also propagated magic and the numerology of the Pure Brethren texts, which986 • Notes to Pages 425–439had been formulated in this generation at Basra. Al-Majriti’s pupils were astronomersand astrologers at Córdoba; one of them (22 in Figure 8.4) propagatedthe Pure Brethren system to Saragossa (one of the independent Muslim states ofthe north), where this astrological occultism was passed along to the first importantJewish philosopher in Spain, Ibn Gabirol (Sirat, 1985: 97). Ibn Gabirol isthe creative individual at the intersection of the networks, connecting also tothe Jewish network of poets and grammarians at Córdoba and Lucena; he becamea famous religious poet in his own right. Another famous contemporary,perhaps also at this cultural center Saragossa, was the Jewish philosopher Bahyaibn Paquda. A second network worthy of note (10, 15, and 26 in Figure 8.4)begins with a follower of al-Sijistani in Baghdad, and continues the tradition oflogic and mathematics first at Córdoba, then at Toledo (where also appear suchscientists as 27 and 28; see key to Figures 8.4 and 8.5). The first scientific star isthe mathematician-astronomer al-Jayyami (25 in Figure 8.4) at Córdoba in themid-1000s.26. Barcelona had been ruled by the Christians since the 800s; in the 1100s it becameone of the first places for translation from Arabic into Latin. Bar Hiyya is notablefor the first Hebrew exposition of the Ptolemaic astronomy and for the firstcomplete solution in Europe of the quadratic equation (DSB, 1981: 1:23), whilehis philosophy is a mixed Neoplatonism reminiscent of the Pure Brethren influencepropagated by Ibn Gabirol at Saragossa. The two cities are 150 miles apart, andfor centuries were the major outposts between which influences flowed across theMuslim-Christian frontier.27. Maimonides himself (1956: 164) reports that he was acquainted with Jabir’s son.The Guide for the Perplexed (pt. 2, chaps. 4–12) contains a section on astronomy.28. See EP (1967: 4:267); DSB (1981: 5:591–592). Ibn Daud is sometimes identifiedwith John of Seville; but John translated in Toledo about 1133–1143, whereasIbn Daud and Gundissalinus came a generation later, in the 1160s (DSB, 1981:15:174, 190).29. Ibn Daud never mentions him, but it is unlikely that they did not know of eachother, as they represented the opposing wings of the Jewish community on thereconciliation of philosophy and scripture.30. At Saragossa, Muslim scientists and Jewish grammarians had had important networksin the previous century; here too was where Ibn Gabirol apparently broughtNeoplatonism and astrological occultism from the Islamic network into Jewishphilosophy, and where Bahya ibn Paquda probably flourished.31. Meir ibn Megas (48 in the key to Figure 8.5), from the main Jewish academy ofLucena, was reputed to be Maimonides’s teacher (Pelaez de Rosal, 1985: 137); likeIbn Daud, Meir had migrated to Toledo as the academy broke up under theAlmohad conquest in 1148. If the young Maimonides studied with Meir at Toledo,it is not unlikely that he would have known Ibn Daud as well.32. Note that Ibn Zaddiq was an official in Córdoba during Ibn Rushd’s youth.33. For instance, the existence of God; God’s unity, perfection, and justice; the creationof the world; validity of prophecy; and survival of the soul after death (Fakhry,1983: 281–283). Ibn Rushd goes on to argue, for example, that the QurÁanNotes to Pages 440–443 • 987nowhere says that creation did not take place from preexisting matter or in preexistingtime; creation consisted only of giving form to the world.34. Ibn Daud states that he wrote his Exalted Faith in order to defend free will; thiswould make a sharp opposition to Ibn Gabirol’s emanationism, in which everythingis a manifestation or even an embodiment of the will of God. In countering thisposition, Ibn Daud produces a lengthy exposition of an Aristotelean universe (Sirat,1985: 142–154).35. Gilson (1944: 358); Fakhry (1983: 275, 292). Ibn Rushd’s Incoherence of theIncoherence, against al-Ghazali, was known in the east; his Aristotle commentarieswere not (Watt, 1985: 119).36. When he was sent into exile in 1195, it was to Lucena, the old Jewish intellectualcenter (Fakhry, 1983: 272). Was this a deliberate slap on the part of his fundamentalistMalikite enemies?37. This connection to the Christian philosophers is even more direct in the case ofIbn Daud, who was the first to bring forth Aristoteleanism as an alternative toNeoplatonism. Ibn Daud apparently began his intellectual career by collaboratingat Toledo with Gundissalinus on translating the Neoplatonists, Ibn Sina, andpossibly Ibn Gabirol; this intimate familiarity with their texts, as well as with theChristian demand for idea imports, could then have motivated him to go on tocriticize the Neoplatonist position and put forward Aristotle as an alternative.38. One can see the change in the way linguistic lines shifted with the growingnationalism of the times. Virtually all of the Jewish philosophers wrote in Arabicup through Ibn Daud and Maimonides. The first step in nationalist reaction wasto translate the Jewish philosophers into Hebrew: Judah ibn Tibbon (49 in Figure8.5, father of Maimonides’s translator Samuel ibn Tibbon, 56), fled the Almohadsto southern France, and translated Bahya ibn Paquda, Halevi, and Gabirol intoHebrew (Sirat, 1985: 213). After 1200 the Jews composed their original works inHebrew, or occasionally in Latin or a secular European language.39. Like most of the historians of world philosophy, I am guilty of slighting theByzantine philosophers. The consensus is that they were “scholars and exegetesrather than creative thinkers” (EP, 1967: 1:436). Kazhdan and Epstein (1985) dolittle to upset this judgment.40. It is dangerous to draw parallels to our own day, since we lack the perspective offuture generations on what philosophical movements mark important turningpoints in the long-run attention space. Imports of French and German philosophiesinto the anglophone world have brought local reputations for their importers; theeffects on indigenous creativity remain to be seen. On the side of the exporters,see Lamont (1987) for evidence that Derrida’s reputation was constructed moreoutside France than within its home network.9. Medieval Christendom1.

Sources on papalorganizational growth (Southern, 1970; Ullman, 1970; Kelley, 1986; Poole, 1915;Waley, 1961).3. Ranking of philosophers into major, secondary, and minor is done according totheir long-term influence, indexed by the amount of reference to them in numeroussources (Windelband, [1892] 1901; Geyer, 1928; Gilson, 1944; de Wulf,1934–1947; Copleston, 1950–1977; Knowles, 1962; Weinberg, 1964; EP, 1967;CHLMP, 1982). The account of philosophical positions draws generally on theseand other sources (Pieper, [1950], 1960; Evans, 1980; Paré, Brunet, and Tremblay,1933; Southern, 1995; individual articles in EP, 1967, and DSB, 1981).4. The debate over the Forms goes back to Plato’s Parmenides and Aristotle’s Metaphysics.Nominalism was upheld by Socrates’ contemporary and rival Antisthenes,and later by some of the Stoics, who incorporated materials from the Cynicposition flowing from Antisthenes (Weinberg, 1964: 80). The early medievalspicked up the most prominent puzzle in the literature available to them, the textson ancient logic.5. In Figure 9.4 and the key these are 66, the translator and astrologer Michael Scotus;as well as 78, 79, 94, 95, 96, 97, and Albert’s Dominican protégé, 92.6. The number of Dominican houses by this time was equal to that of the Cistercians,while the Franciscan total was much greater (Southern, 1970: 285).7. A few of the leading philosophers were Augustinian monks, such as Giles ofRome. The Cistercians reversed their anti-intellectual stance and established collegesat Paris and elsewhere from the 1240s, although they had no notable philosophersuntil the idiosyncratic Jean of Mirecourt a century later. There were alsosubstantial numbers of Benedictines at the universities; to judge from the figuresat Oxford (Cobban, 1988: 318–319), they were about two thirds of the friars’total, but they played no part in intellectual leadership. It was the Franciscans andDominicans specifically, not the monks in general, who provided the creativity ofthis period. And they were a minority of the university students; again judgingfrom Oxford, the friars made up about 10 percent of the total. They are importantin philosophy in part because they almost all concentrated in theology, whereastwo thirds of the secular clergy were studying canon or civil law (Cobban, 1988:214–215).8. The curriculum within the arts faculty (later to become known as the philosophicalfaculty), consisted of the trivium (grammar, rhetoric, logic) and the quadrivium(arithmetic, geometry, music—i.e., arithmetical theory of tones—and astronomy).The Christian schools had begun by taking over the compendium of knowledge atthe end of the Roman era, combining respectively the contents of the rhetoricschools with the scientific curriculum of the Neo-Pythagoreans. The higher facultiesderived from the distinctive structures of licensed professions which emerged inmedieval Europe. Within Christendom, the messy and conflictual overlap betweenchurch and state made for separate professions of lawyers and theologians notfound in China or Islam, nor in the pagan Greek and Roman schools, wherelawyer-rhetorician was the primary profession but theologians did not exist in theNotes to Pages 458–475 • 989absence of a bureaucratic church. In Christendom medicine became a learnedsubject claiming the licensing privileges of the university corporation, again unlikein China and India, where it was a practice of private individuals or guilds ofhealers and magicians, and in Islam, where medicine was not admitted to thetheological/legalist–dominated madrasas. As we shall see in Chapter 12, this differentiationof disciplines within the university was later to shape European intellectuallife in a distinctive pathway, after the establishment of the research universityin Germany around 1800.9. The apex of papal power was during 1235–1248, when the German emperor wassuccessfully excommunicated, defeated in war by papal allies, and deposed. TheGermans were finally evicted from northern Italy in 1268 by a French armyfinanced by the pope. In the 1270s the French king began to claim the right to taxthe clergy for war expenses, which led to an open break in 1296–1303. This timethe pope lost. In 1305 the new pope was a Frenchman, compliant with Frenchpolicies, and in 1309 the Curia had moved to Avignon (Keen, 1968: 170–177,207–221; Boase, 1933).10. From here through the discussion of Ockham, we enter a progressively rarefyinglevel of philosophical abstraction. The reader is invited to scan the section “Nominalismversus Realism of Universals” in Chapter 15 (pages 826–830) to keep tabson the chess game of move and countermove in intellectual space.11. Duns is a close parallel to Aquinas in this respect. Although there was oppositionin the Dominican order, Aquinas was clearly the favorite of its dominant faction.As Albert’s star pupil, Thomas was named the Dominicans’ teacher at the papalCuria in Rome; the Minister General of the order personally directed him to writehis great Summa contra Gentiles. When the Averroist controversy broke out in fullforce in the 1270s, Aquinas was sent back to Paris to combat it (Gilson, 1944:526). Duns similarly came from the inner circles of his order. His family had beenbenefactors of the Franciscans for generations; his uncle was their Vicar Generalfor Scotland, and young John Duns was taken into his uncle’s priory. Extensivelyeducated at Oxford and Paris in the 1280s and 1290s, he was personally sponsoredby Gonsalvus of Spain, the Minister General of the Franciscan order. During theseyears he must have been exposed to the teaching and debates of Giles of Rome,Godfrey of Fontaines, and Henry of Ghent, and would have personally knownfellow Franciscans Richard of Middleton and Peter John Olivi (Bettoni, 1961: 2–6).Scotus was a strong supporter of the pope in his struggles against the kings; in themajor theological movement of the time, Scotus helped the pope in establishingthe dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary.12. Ockham was likely a pupil, or at least a hearer, of Henry of Harclay (141 in Figure9.4) at Oxford, who in turn probably heard Scotus at Paris. Harclay criticizedDuns from a nominalist direction that Ockham was to radicalize. At Avignon,Ockham apparently lived in the Franciscan house with another critical philosopher,Walter of Chatton (147), with whom he carried on a continuing controversy. Healso would have encountered there Duns Scotus’s major disciple (143), Francisof Meyronnes (Gilson, 1944: 633–634; EP, 1967: 3:476–477; CHLMP, 1982:863, 891).990 • Notes to Pages 479–48513. Dante, from the anti-papal faction in Florence, was sympathetic to the Averroistworldview.14. It contained stranger combinations yet, such as Fitz-Ralph (188 in Figure 9.6) ofBalliol, who propounded a syncretism of Averroism and Augustinianism. Positionswhich had lost ground in the struggle for attention became a grab bag, alliancesof the weak.15. This network also ties to non-academic religious reformers such as Thomas Moreand Sebastian Franck. A generation back, the network was fed by Italian Humanistcircles; Reuchlin derived his cultural capital from the Florence group, and theyoung Colet had corresponded with Ficino (EP, 1967: 2:138).16. Popkin (1979: 37–43, 360–361); EP (1967: 5:366–368). Wuthnow (1989: 97–98)points out that the presence of a local parlement in Bordeaux kept the cityorthodox, since the dominant nobility throughout Europe generally had an interestin maintaining the traditional status order of Catholicism. In Toulouse, whereMontaigne probably had studied, an insurrection had been put down in 1562, andhundreds of Protestants were executed.17. This is emphasized throughout CHLMP (1982). The creativity of the nominalistsapparently lasted two generations, dissipating by the late 1300s. It is possible thatlater advances occurred but have been ignored by historians, since this period oflate scholasticism has not been much studied. In any case, this obliviousness tonominalist innovation started very early, with its contemporaries.18. The sheer complexity of argument tended to bury it. The works of Dullaert ofGhent (315 in the key to Figure 9.7), at Paris in the early 1500s, “summarize ingreat detail (and usually with hopelessly involved logical argument) the teachingsof Oxford ‘calculatores’ such as Thomas Bradwardine, William Heytesbury, andRichard Swineshead; of Paris ‘terminists’ such as Jean Buridan, Albert of Saxony,and Nicole Oresme; and of Italian authors such as James of Forli, Simon ofLendenaria, and Peter of Mantua—while not neglecting the more realist positionsof Walter Burley and Paul of Venice. The logical subtlety of Dullaert’s endlessdialectics provoked considerable adverse criticism from Vives (Dullaert’s student)and other humanists” (DSB, 1981: 9:237). Two generations later, the leadingAristotelean in Italy, Zabarella (352), at the great University of Padua, discussedAristotelean physics in complete ignorance of the work of the Merton College andBuridan groups (EP, 1967: 8:366).19. The failure rate for the 1200s is skewed upward by several failures in the 1290s;prior to that point the success rate was quite high. Estimates of undercounting of“paper universities,” which received charters but failed to come into existence,probably make the failure rate for the 1400s 10 to 15 percent too low; see Rashdall(1936: 2:325–331). Enrollment data from Rashdall (1936: 2:149, 171, 178–191);Stone (1974b: 91); Simon (1966: 245).20. The military and political struggle between pope and emperor during the 1200sprobably explains why there were no universities chartered there during thatperiod. The Italian ambitions of the emperor finally collapsed in the 1340s, as thepapacy weakened as well. Soon thereafter Prague University was founded, withcharters from both emperor and pope.Notes to Pages 488–518 • 99110. Cross-Breeding Networks and Rapid-Discovery Science1. When not otherwise cited, biographical and network information throughoutChapters 10–14 comes from the relevant articles in DSB and EP as well as otherbasic sources (Copleston, 1950–1977; Merz, [1904–1912] 1965; Heer, [1953]1968; Chambers Biographical Dictionary; 1984; Popkin, 1979; Johnston, 1972;Schnädelbach, 1984; Toews, 1980, 1993; Köhnke, 1991; Willey, 1978; Lindenfeld,1980; Ben-David and Collins, 1966; Dickey, 1993; Ayer, 1982; Coffa, 1991;Waismann, 1979; Dummett, 1981; Wang, 1987; Kline, 1972; Boyer, 1985; Levy,1981; Spiegelberg, 1982; Gadamer, 1985; Fabiani, 1988; Cohen-Solal, 1987;Boschetti, 1985).2. Michael Mahoney (private communication) points to a number of overlappingParisian circles, in addition to the Mersenne-Montmor groups, around Le Pailleur,Thévenot, and Bourdelot, and materially sponsored by the royal minister Colbert;collectively these became in 1666 the basis of the Académie des Sciences. Figure10.1 omits most purely scientific academies and circles.3. As in previous chapters, the ranking of philosophers as major, secondary, andminor is based on their long-term influence; this is estimated by the relative spacewhich they receive in various histories (Hegel, [1820–1830] 1971; Windelband,[1892] 1901; Lévi-Bruhl, 1899; Bentley, 1939; Heer, [1953] 1968; Copleston,1950–1977; Marias, [1941] 1966; EP, 1967; Passmore, 1968; Kneale and Kneale,1984). On the growth of the European philosophical canon as viewed by anglophonescholarship, cf. Kuklick (1984).4. Structurally this is the same condition I noted in Chapter 9 in comparing stagnantwith creative periods: an intersection of overlapping and rival circles. The materialimprovement of transportation and communications in the 1600s broadened thegeographical zone in which such an intersection of circles could take place.5. It is impossible to avoid some anachronism in terminology. “Science” took on itsrestricted modern meaning in English after 1847. Latin scientia was equivalent toGreek episteme, knowledge in any realm. Some term is needed for making historicalcomparisons, precisely so that we can see what is distinctive about certain activitiesin various periods. “Science” enables us to focus jointly on the several activities ofcollecting information by observations of nature, especially in the well-definedoccupations of astronomy and medicine, and the equally distinctive activity ofmathematical calculation and measurement.6. Price (1986). Sources for discussion of various methods by which speed of scientificdiscovery may be measured (Cole, 1983; Griffith, 1988; Cozzens, 1989; Leydesdorffand Amsterdamska, 1990; Collins, 1994). The rapid-discovery mode set inearlier in some scientific fields than others, and the rate appears to have acceleratedseveral times, most recently since the 1920s. On differences in consensus, see Cole,Cole, and Dietrich (1978); Hargens and Hagstrom (1982).7. Highly accurate calculations of pi made between 220 and 500 c.e. were variouslyand often inaccurately recorded in the standard textbooks of the T’ang and Sung,which sometimes gave the traditional value of pi as 3 (Institute, 1983: 86–87, 35,992 • Notes to Pages 528–53338; Mikami, 1913: 45–58; Qian, 1985: 62–63; Ho, 1985: 125–127; Chen, 1987:77–85; Li and Du, 1987). Algebra reached sophisticated methods in the solutionof higher-order equations between 1200 and Chu Shih-chieh’s work in 1303; fiftyyears later textbooks had reverted to an elementary level of arithmetic (Ho, 1985:106). In the 1500s those who still recorded the Sung “celestial element” algebrawere no longer able to understand it (Mikami, 1913: 110). For other instances ofloss of advanced work, see Ho (1985: 72, 77); Needham (1959: 31, 33); Mikami(1913: 37–39).8. In India, Aryabhata I (late 400s c.e.) expounded two astronomical systems; shortlythereafter Varahamihira (ca. 500 c.e.) described five systems, one based on Vedicastrology and four on Greek models (DSB, 1981: 15:533–632). Chinese astronomywas always divided among competing models. In the Han dynasty there was astruggle between advocates of the kaitian (hemispherical dome) and huntian (celestialsphere) cosmologies; in addition, two other systems were known. Thehuntian model became dominant in the astronomical bureaus of dynasties after550 c.e., but there continued to be advocates of a rival model as late as the Sung.During the T’ang dynasty, there were three different schools of Indian astronomersemployed at the imperial observatory, but without influence on Chinese astronomers.In the Yuan and Ming dynasties, there were Arab astronomers in officialservice, but Chinese astronomers ignored the Arab-Ptolemaic epicyclic planetarytheory (Needham, 1959: 171–436; Sivin, 1969; Ho, 1985: 82, 129, 161–168;Mikami, 1913: 101–106).9. There is evidence of around five competing research groups in a scientific specialty(Price, [1963] 1986: 130–133).10. Thus Boyle’s vacuum pump could not be successfully imitated by anyone who hadnot physically used an earlier exemplar (Shapin and Shaffer, 1985: 229–230, 281).Harry Collins (1974) emphasizes that tacit knowledge of how to do research mustbe transmitted by a personal network of craft-like apprenticeship, since it cannotbe encoded in purely verbal instructions. Latour’s (1987) depiction of science as anetwork of human plus non-human actors may well anthropomorphize the naturalworld, but it has this much justification: research-front science includes an ongoingnetwork of scientists together with the genealogy of machines on which they areparasites, and vice versa.11. Many examples are given in Braudel ([1967] 1973: 244–324) in which technologiesstagnated for hundreds of years, including during the European centuries of thescientific revolution. And even where there were periods of technological innovation,they did not spill over into lineages of scientific research technology unlessthey were carried by intellectual networks. Thus the periods of innovation inweaponry, shipping, and construction engineering at various times in the historyof Hellenistic Greece, the Islamic world, and medieval Christendom did not connectto intellectuals or become rapid-discovery science. See references in Collins (1986:77–116).12. The number of mathematicians treated in DSB (1981) active in each third of acentury is as follows:Notes to Pages 534–538 • 9931200s: 3–4–71300s: 5–6–01400s: 2–3–101500s: 17–18–261600s: 37–44–231700s: 19–39–34Moreover, before 1500, most of the names listed are persons who recorded anymathematics even without originality; the criterion for listing shifts over in the1500s to original contributions.13. The first use of the equal sign () was in Recorde’s 1551 book on elementarycommercial arithmetic; what would become the modern notation for operationswas popularized in England by Harriot’s 1621 textbook. Neither book containedany original mathematics. On the history of notation generally, see Cajori (1928).14. See Figure 10.1. The other major philosophers are Bacon, Hobbes, Spinoza, andLocke. If we look not at overlaps between the scientific and philosophical networksbut at personal contacts among their members, we find that all of the majorphilosophers are within one link of a significantly creative scientist, and 12 of 14secondary philosophers are within two links of a scientist. The only major philosopherwho is not an active scientist, Locke, is a medical doctor, directly connectedwith 2 scientific stars and a host of other scientists. The fact of their working inscience does not imply that the work of these philosophers is itself a significantcontribution; Bacon’s experiments, for example, led to no important discoveries.Here I use the strong criterion, indicated in note 19, for identifying scientists. I willoften use the term science to include both science and mathematics; it should beobvious from the context when I am using it in a more restricted sense, exclusiveof the activities of mathematicians.15. During 1700–1900, 5 of 13 major philosophers were active in science (Berkeley,Kant, Schelling, Peirce, James), and 10 of 13 are within one link of an importantscientist. Of secondary philosophers, 14 of 46 are scientists, and 33 are within twolinks of one.16. We see this by comparing Figure 10.2 (network of Greek mathematicians) withFigures 3.1 to 3.8 (network of Greek philosophers). Sources for Greek mathematicians(Heath, [1921] 1981; Smith, 1951; Ball, [1908] 1960; Cajori, 1928; Knorr,1975; Neugebauer, 1957; Boyer, 1985; Kline, 1972; van der Waerden, 1975; DSB,1981).17. This may be traced in the key to Figure 3.4 by noting the figures marked “medicine,”beginning with the merging of the Hippocratic lineage with the networkaround Aristotle and the Alexandria schools (71, 75, 76, 108). These connectionsare not depicted in Figure 3.4 itself to avoid overcomplicating the diagram.18. As we saw in Chapter 8, the creativity of this original Baghdad group derived notsimply from Greek imports but from the cosmopolitan situation which combinedthese with materials from Babylonian sects and Indian astronomers, resulting inal-Khwarizmi’s encyclopedic synthesis in the early 800s. By the generations of994 • Notes to Pages 539–546965–1035, this elementary algebra had been developed to the high points of worldmathematics at the time, al-Buzjani’s Diophantine equations and al-Karaji’s theoryof algebraic calculation and algebra of polynomials, breaking with geometricalrepresentations into an arithmeticized algebra. The Spanish network began around965 with migrants from the Pure Brethren, numerological cosmologists branchingfrom the Baghdad scientific network. Within a few generations this spread to theJews (initially via numerology); it blossomed simultaneously into creative astronomy(e.g., al-Bitruji’s revision of the Ptolemaic system in the late 1100s) and thework of the major Jewish and Muslim philosophers. The scientific-philosophicalnetwork was disrupted in the eastern region around 1100. It was reestablished byJewish travelers back from Spain: Abraham Ibn Ezra and Maimonides, who linkedto the network around the Jewish doctor and astronomer Abu-l-Barakat andonward to the major astronomer al-Tusi and his lineage. The Jews played the roleof cosmopolitan transmitters twice, not only to Christian Europe but also to thehigh point of Iranian Muslim science.19. If we use the loose criterion of writing on some aspect of natural science, we wouldhave to include 8 of 11 major philosophers (72 percent) and 19 of 48 secondary(40 percent) in medieval Christendom. By a stricter criterion (formulating principlesin astronomy or physics, collecting naturalistic observations, or making atleast crude calculations), we still find 45 percent of major and 23 percent ofsecondary Christian philosophers active in science. For comparison let us use astrong criterion: contributing actively to astronomy, mathematics, medicine, ornaturalist observation. In Greece, 14 of 28 major philosophers were themselvesscientists; in medieval Islam (including Jews), 5 of 11; in Europe, 1600–1900, 10of 19. The percentages are similar in all four places: Greece, 50 percent; Islam/Jews,45 percent; Christendom, 45 percent; Europe, 53 percent. Throughout the West,the most influential philosophers tend to be more interested in science than lessinfluential philosophers. Among secondary philosophers, the percentages of overlapare lower everywhere: Greece, 28 percent (19 of 68); Islam, 20 percent (8 of41); Christendom, 23 percent (11 of 48); and Europe, 28 percent (17 of 60). If weextend the perimeter to two links from the scientific network, the pattern is similareverywhere: for major philosophers, Greece, 82 percent; Islam, 82 percent, Christendom,73 percent, Europe, 89 percent; for secondaries, Greece, 50 percent,Christendom, 44 percent, and Islam, 44 percent though here Europe stands outwith 76 percent within the periphery of scientists.20. Eminence among scientists and mathematicians is measured in the same way asfor philosophers: by the relative amount of space devoted to them in histories ofthose periods.21. In China, of 25 major philosophers, 6 (24 percent) were involved in some way inmathematical science, for the most part very tangentially. Among secondary philosophers,7 of 61 (11 percent) were involved in astronomy, and only one of them,Liu Hsin in the Han dynasty, was an important astronomer. An additional 6 namesof astronomers overlap the list of minor philosophers, making up less than 2percent of the total. Extending the network outward, we find a mathematicalNotes to Pages 548–549 • 995scientist within two links for 16 of 25 major philosophers (64 percent) and for 15of 61 secondaries (25 percent). If we start from the side of the mathematiciansand astronomers, of the 12 major figures, none has any direct contact with philosophersimportant enough to be listed even as minor figures, and only 1 (thestate astronomer Shen Kua, during the Sung dynasty) is within two links of aknown philosopher. Of 9 mathematical scientists of secondary importance, only 1has any philosophical contacts. By comparison, 63 percent of major Islamic scientists(12 of 19) are within two links of a known philosopher. Sources on Chinesemathematicians (Mikami, 1913; Needham, 1959; Sivin, 1969; Libbrecht, 1973;Nakayama and Sivin, 1973; Swetz and Kao, 1977; Graham, 1978; CHC, 1979,1986; DSB, 1981; Institute, 1983; Ho, 1985; Qian, 1985; Chen, 1987; Li and Du,1987).22. The exception which proves the rule is the Buddhist monk I-hsing, the onlyimportant Buddhist mathematician and astronomer. He worked for the emperorat the time of the abortive Buddhist near-theocracy in the early 700s, and in thesame temple where the great Hua-yen philosophy was created in the previousgeneration.23. The method was revived and extended in Tokugawa Japan, leading to indigenousdevelopment of the calculus (Smith and Mikami, 1914). Here again we see a briefconfluence of networks. Mathematics was carried in a network of samurai, bureaucraticofficials of the shogun, and other high-ranking lords in positions concernedwith accounts, astronomy, and other practical administration. By itself thiswas not conducive to intellectualized mathematics; but by the 1670s, these mathematician-officials were also running private schools in Edo and Kyoto, similar tothe competitive expansion of Confucian schools which underpinned the philosophicaloutburst of the same period. Merely practical considerations were transcendedby social competition over prestige; much as in Italy during the time of Tartagliaand Cardano, leading mathematicians attracted pupils by publishing problems andchallenging others to solve them. Topics went far beyond practical problems,beginning with magic squares and circles, escalating to solving equations of veryhigh degree. The most important developments from circle measurement problemsto an integral calculus were made in the school of Seki Kowa from the 1670sthrough the early 1700s. Methods were kept secret, although occasionally spilledout in publications during the late 1700s. In the key period of innovation, themathematical networks connected with the philosophical centers. Seki worked forthe same Edo lord who employed the somewhat younger Ogyu Sorai; a Sekigrandpupil became head of the Mito school. The mathematical lineages continueddown through the early 1800s, but the connection with philosophy was not takenfurther; mathematics did not become invoked as an epistemological ideal, andmathematical methods were not generalized as abstract principles. Mathematicalinnovation stagnated after the mid-1700s; most likely the increasing bureaucratizationof education in the later Tokugawa had a restricting effect on mathematicsjust as it did on philosophy. The wide expansion of low-status practical trainingschools for commercial mathematics, stimulated by the growth of the commercial996 • Notes to Pages 550–551economy, remained separate from the samurai schools, and had no effect oninnovation in abstract mathematics (Dore, 1965).24. We see this in the surrounding conditions of several episodes of takeoff in intellectualmathematics: Athens established a monetized retail market in the late 400sb.c.e., and from 330 to 100 b.c.e. the international grain trade, centered onAlexandria, broke out of the usual government-administered exchange into theonly competitive price-setting markets in antiquity (Polanyi, 1977: 238–251; Finley,1973). Tokugawa Japan was a period of commercial capitalist boom; Italianand German cities of the 1400s and 1500s were commercial and banking centers.In the latter two cases we know explicitly that numeracy spread widely in the urbanpopulation, and there were many commercial schools teaching practical mathematics.Swetz (1987) and, in a Marxian version, Sohn-Rethel (1978) argue on thebasis of this correlation that capitalism produced the mathematical worldview.25. In Tokugawa Japan a rapidly expanding capitalist market, based on Weberianstructural conditions, had very little innovation in machinery but a great deal ofinnovation in refinements of production for specialized market niches (Morris-Suzuki, 1994).26. Rheticus in turn visited Cardano in 1545, and Cardano dedicated his great mathematicalwork Ars Magna to Osiander. The work was published in Nuremberg bythe printer of De Revolutionibus (Blumenberg, 1987: 340). Cardano, in contactwith virtually every innovative network, was also a friend of Vesalius. Historicalsources on mathematicians of this period (DSB, 1981; Kline, 1972; Boyer, 1985;Smith, 1951; Cardan, [1575] 1962).27. Michael Mahoney (personal communication) suggests that Copernicus’s newmodel was worked out within the long-standing Ptolemaic tradition of astronomy,eliminating some spheres and thereby better preserving Aristotle’s cosmology; thusCopernicus belongs to a “reestablished classical tradition.” Copernicus differs fromOresme in that he actually worked out the mathematics in detail; along the way,as I noted earlier, he took part in developing new trigonometric tables to speed upcalculations.28. Brunelleschi and Alberti became concerned with the geometry of perspective in theearly 1400s, and Piero della Francesca treated the subject in a mathematical treatisein 1478. The painters too were raising their status by connecting their manual craftto an academic field; the result was to widen audiences and increase the focus ofattention all around.29. Notice that Descartes met Beeckman in 1618, before either of them did the workthat would make them famous: yet another case of a network forming a nodewhich promotes the later success of its members.30. The intention is plain despite continuities in terminology. The new science isvariously referred to as “natural” or “mechanical philosophy,” or sometimesmerely “philosophy” (e.g., Bacon De Dig. 1.3). As did others, Descartes (inPrinciples) distinguished his “Philosophy” from “that which is taught in theschools” (Descartes, [1644] 1983: xxvi).31. Here we see one of the weaknesses of the Burtt-Koyré thesis that the scientificNotes to Pages 553–563 • 997revolution derives from the metaphysical assumptions of a Neoplatonic cosmology.It is not only that many of the scientific innovators were not following thisparticular metaphysics, or were more concerned with the adequacy of technicalmatters (Hatfield, 1990). The numerous competing strands of late scholastic,Humanist, and occultist philosophies between 1400 and 1600 constituted anintellectual field without a focus of attention; these are structural conditions forstagnation rather than for the dynamism of discovery. The main effect of philosophyon the mathematical and scientific revolutions was on the level of socialstructures; math and science networks were stimulated to make their argumentson a higher level of generality when they intersected with the networks of theologiansand philosophers. The importance of this contact is not primarily throughthe transmission of philosophical capital into math and science, but in transmissionof the emotional energy of intellectual competition characteristic of the philosophicalnetworks.32. Kangro (1968). Like Harvey, Jungius was a medical doctor from the Padua network.33. Upheaval in the material bases of intellectual life fosters creativity in severaldirections at once. The last glory of Latin stylistics sprang up in the generationsjust before Bacon and Descartes: the anti-Ciceronian and Attic prose movements,which encompassed Montaigne and his teachers and lasted until the time of Milton(Croll, 1966). Descartes and especially Bacon were noted Latin prose stylists, alongwith their other accomplishments. As we have seen in the case of Greek philosophy,there is creativity in the moment of closing down an intellectual structure as wellof opening one up.34. Viète and Descartes’s father were both members of the Parlement of Brittany, andViète was counselor at Tours in the 1590s, near Descartes’s home (DSB, 1981:4:51, 14:52). The fame of Viète’s mathematics may have made an impression onDescartes in this way. Notice the parallel instances showing the public prestige ofmathematical puzzle-solving: in 1593 the Dutch ambassador put a mathematicalchallenge to the French court involving an equation of the forty-fifth degree, whichViète solved. Descartes first became interested in mathematics through a challengeto solve a geometrical problem announced on a public placard in Breda, Holland,in 1618. It was on this occasion that he met Beeckman (Gaukroger, 1995: 68).35. As Michael Mahoney (personal communication) puts it, Descartes’s symbolism“was essentially different from earlier systems of notation. It was operational. Thatis, the symbols revealed through their structure the operations being carried onthem, so that one did the mathematics by manipulating the symbols . . . Moreover,unlike cossist algebra, Viéte’s and Descartes’ systems symbolized both knowns andunknowns, making it possible then to unfold the structure of equations viewed asgeneral relations.” Descartes had a “drive for generality.”36. Hatfield (1990: 159). Descartes does have a place for empirical observation, in thesense that “the truths that can be deduced from . . . Principles” include many whichwill not be noticed until “certain specific observations” are made. For the advancementof science, experiments must be made by those who know how to unite theirresults with a deductive system (Descartes [1644] 1983: xxvii).998 • Notes to Pages 565–56811. Secularization and Philosophical Meta-territoriality1. Compare the general model of political revolutions in Skocpol (1979) and Goldstone(1991).2. In Figure 9.7, this is the lineage of prominent Scotists and nominalists (see 295and 299 in the key), of whom the most notable was John Mair (314), the teacherof the reformer John Knox; Mair’s successors include Dullaert of Ghent (315),Thomist natural philosopher and editor of Buridan; Vives; and the leadingThomists of the period—all of whom were now teaching in Spain—Crockoert,Vitoria, Cano, de Soto, and Medina (335, 337, 338, 340, 341).3. Aquinas had held that only in God are existence and essence united. Suarez heldthat this is true of finite beings as well. This sharpens the problem of how tocharacterize contingency, which led Leibniz to his distinction among kinds ofnecessity, logical and physical (Funkenstein, 1986: 118–121, 198).4. Kagan (1974); Collins (1979: 4, 92). By comparison to Spain, consider the factthat England also was in an educational boom period during 1580–1670, whenuniversity students were about 1 percent of the late teen population, according toStone’s (1974a) calculations, a ratio which dropped back to one third this level inthe 1700s. In both Spain and England, the educational boom went along with anoutburst of intellectual activity.5. Bérulle is one of the main connections to Spanish movements. He was ambassadorto Spain, and introduced the Carmelites—Saint Teresa’s order—into France. Theconflict of the Oratorians versus the Jesuits structurally continued earlier battlesin Spain (EP, 1967: 2:345–355; Ariew, 1990). See 31, 88, and 134 in the key toFigure 10.1.6. Truchet (1967). The contemporary Spanish Jesuit, Balthazar Gracian, whose Artof Prudence (1647) is a manual on how to survive in a treacherous world by usingdeceit, had provided a model admired by Mme. de Sablé. Here we see the inneraffinity of Jansenists and Jesuits beneath their surface antagonism.7. In the same way the Cambridge Platonists, who published most of their worksduring this time, were absorbed in the flux of attention by more striking formulationsof spiritual primacy. Henry More’s tutee Lady Anne Conway formulated amonistic ontology of spirits emanating from God, with matter at the lowest levelas congealed spirit (Audi, 1995: 162, 513). Conway made little impact on theattention space: in part from sexist disregard of women, in part from her conversionto Quakerism, and above all because this Neoplatonist-sounding position wasupstaged. On the other side, Locke produced the most defensible version of theprimacy of extended matter, which eclipsed the earlier efforts on this side of theturf: those of Gassendi, who was not wholeheartedly modernist or secularist, andHobbes, whose reputation survives because of his political philosophy rather thanhis ontology.8. In Figure 10.1, note in the network 19, 31, 43–45, 97–98 and their ties. On theepisodes recounted in the text, see Popkin (1979) and the relevant articles in EP(1967). The first round of controversy began with the arrival of Uriel da Costa, acrypto-Jew (i.e., forced convert to Christianity) who had studied at Coimbra, whichNotes to Pages 573–590 • 999had been the Portuguese base for the Jesuit philosophers Molina and Suarez. In1624 da Costa interpreted religion as a human creation. For this he was excommunicatedby the Jews and his books burned by the Dutch; he committed suicidein 1640.9. On the gradual development of Spinoza’s monism; see Funkenstein (1986: 81–87).10. Brown (1984: 15–31); Funkenstein (1986: 118–123). The intellectual energy generatedby this Leipzig milieu is shown in Figure 10.1: Leibniz’s teacher Weigel hadpreviously taught Pufendorf, who became a famous legal philosopher and, likeLeibniz, proponent of universal law. Another of Leibniz’s teachers was the fatherof the other notable German philosopher of this generation; this was Thomasius,who began as a natural lawyer, converted to Pietism in 1694, and produced aphilosophy of mystical vitalism. Again there was a structural rivalry; the Pietists,who were the equivalent of the Catholic fideists in the context of ProtestantGermany, became the main opponents of Leibniz’s lineage, including Wolff and hisfollowers.11. Broad (1975: 43); Mahoney (1990). Leibniz was publishing his “calculus of transcendentqualities” and his new dynamics between 1684 and 1694, just the yearsin which he worked out his philosophical system: Discourse on Metaphysics(1684–85); correspondence with Arnauld (1686–1690); New System (1695).12. “Space is nothing but the order of co-existing things and time the order ofsuccessive things” (quoted in Brown, 1984: 147; see also 115). In keeping withthis point, Leibniz criticizes Newton’s physics for assuming a frame of empty space,just as he rejects his theory of gravity as action-at-a-distance, since a vacuum doesnot exist in Leibniz’s metaphysics.13. Hobbes’s important works were all produced at a rather advanced age: his contributionto Descartes’s Meditations on the First Philosophy in 1641 (age 53); DeCive, his first published treatise on political power, 1642 (54); Leviathan 1651(63); De Corpore, containing his most thorough scientific materialism, 1655 (67).As in other cases, creativity had nothing to do with age, but with the moment ofcontact with the central intellectual networks. On Hobbes’s career trajectory, seeMacpherson (1968); Shapin and Schaffer (1985); Lynch (1991).14. Locke took over some of Cudworth’s arguments straightforwardly. His argumentin the Essay (4.10) for the existence of God is identical to Cudworth’s: that nothingcan come from nothing, and the existence of something implies the existence ofan eternal creator (Copleston, 1950–1977: 5:58; Locke, [1690] 1959: bk. 4.10).This is the only point, along with the self-evident existence of the self, on whichLocke admits knowledge derived other than from the senses.15. Juan de Prado, who had been excommunicated from the synagogue in 1656 alongwith Spinoza, supported natural religion and was attacked by Orobio de Castro,who defended Jewish orthodoxy with Cartesian and Spinozaist weapons, a geometricsequence of proofs. Orobio wielded the same weapons against Christianity,and Locke was present at a debate in Amsterdam in 1684 on this topic, which hereviewed in one of his earliest publications (EP, 1967: 5:552). Bayle, not yet famousat the time when Locke met him, was similarly stimulated by the milieu of Jewishcontroversies over natural religion.1000 • Notes to Pages 590–59916. Leibniz stresses the argument for innate ideas in his Discourse, written in 1686but left unpublished; Locke’s Essay was completed the following year.17. Lord Herbert of Cherbury, who had been English ambassador to France duringthe religious maneuvers of the 1620s, had argued for a minimalist religion basedon common notions and the common consent of mankind; this argument was putforward in 1645, amidst the fervors of the Civil War, as a critique of religiousauthoritarianism. Locke has a network contact here too; Locke’s friend at the timehe wrote the first draft of his Essay (during his stay in France in the late 1670s)was Cherbury’s grandson Thomas Herbert, who as earl of Pembroke was to receivethe dedication of the publication (Fraser, [1894] 1959: xxviii). Pembroke laterreceived the dedication of Berkeley’s Principles of Human Knowledge in 1710—anindication of the emerging split within the network of Locke’s successors.18. An exemplary figure is Dryden (110 in the key to Figure 10.1). A supporter ofCromwell in the 1650s, he shifted to the Royalist court thereafter and was madepoet laureate and court historian. In the early 1680s he wrote poetic satiresdefending the king’s party against the Whigs; in 1685 he followed court fashionand converted to Catholicism. Even with the Glorious Revolution he landed onhis feet; in the 1690s he launched the dramatic career of Congreve (later recipientof Whig sinecures), and protected the Deist Blount.19. These writers not only gave prestige to their political patrons but propagandizedon their behalf as well. Swift in London during 1710–1714 edited the Tory partymagazine. In the opposing literary circle, Addison made his reputation for poemscelebrating Whig military victory and wrote the Whig attack on the Treaty ofUtrecht which brought down the Tory ministry in 1714. Steele started as a gazeteerfor Lord Harley, and edited Whig periodicals including Tatler and Spectator.Addison was rewarded by becoming secretary of state; Steele received a parliamentaryseat.20. The lineage of Boulainvilliers’s teachers goes back to the controversies over naturalreligion at Amsterdam in the 1650s. After La Peyrère’s scandalous pre-Adamitethesis got him arrested, he recanted and took refuge in the Oratorian college atJuilly. There Richard Simon continued La Peyrère’s project, producing in 1678 ahistorical critique of the Old Testament, which was in turn banned by Bossuet. Inthe next generation Simon’s student was Boulainvilliers. In Boulainvilliers’s philosophythe cogito implies a universal Being wider than matter; on this Boulainvillierserects a natural religion, in which the body after death returns to universalmatter while the soul remains an idea in the infinite mind (EP, 1967: 1:354; Roger,1964: 6–7; Heer, [1953] 1968: 188).21. Burrage (1993); Ariès (1962: 195–237); Heilbron (1994). The same collapse ofenrollments and loss of professional credentialing is characteristic of the universitiesin England after 1670. In both places intellectuals operated in secular life andscorned the formalities of university lectures and examinations as “silly and obsolete,”“childish and useless exercises” (Green, 1969: 50; Stone, 1974b).22. Condillac, the one member of the circle of Encyclopedists who came from auniversity background in theology, was the one who took up a traditional philosophicaltopic, although he did it using the new anti-metaphysical capital importedNotes to Pages 600–606 • 1001from Britain by his network fellows, building a theory of mind on Locke andNewton.23. I place “modern” in quotes to indicate that this is a historically relative usage. Thealliance among religious and political liberalism and science, and among theiropposites on the conservative side, was at its height in the Enlightenment and inthe 1800s. The alliance has been breaking down in our own times, beginning withthe existentialists and continuing through the postmodernists.24. DSB (1981: 10:42–102); Westfall [1981]. Newton had early contacts with the mainmathematical network too. His teacher Barrow had been a Royalist, unlike theOxford scientists; ousted from his Cambridge fellowship in 1655, he toured theContinent and met the leading mathematicians, likely including Fermat and Roberval.Although Barrow’s substantive influence may not have been great, Newtonwas thereby made aware of the forefront of mathematical problems, and it wasupon this terrain that he made his youthful contributions in the mid-1660s to thecalculus and infinite series. Barrow recommended Newton as his successor whenhe gave up the Lucasian professorship of mathematics in 1669 to take the professorshipin divinity. This suggests the order of precedence at Cambridge at this time:theology was regarded as more significant than science, and Newton shows thesame priorities in his own work before 1684.25. Berkeley was very young compared to other philosophers at their height of creativity:25 years old when he published his masterwork, Principles of HumanKnowledge. A similar case is Schelling, who burst on the philosophical scene inGermany at the age of 20. In both cases there was early contact with a corenetwork, at a time when the structural situation was rapidly changing. For contrastthere are the aged Hobbes and Locke. Young or old, whoever gets onto the centralturf at those moments reaps the fame.26. See Hume’s Letters (Greig, 1932: 23). Hume presents himself in the Introductionof his Treatise as a follower of Locke, Shaftesbury, Butler, and the other Deists. Ina private letter in 1737, however, he points to Descartes, Malebranche, Bayle,and Berkeley as keys to his Treatise, suggesting the wider intellectual sphere atwhich he was aiming. This was just the time when Newton’s calculus of fluxionswas coming under attack for its glib assumptions about infinitesimals. In 1734Berkeley joined the fray with an extended critique, following the points he hadraised against mathematics in his New Theory of Vision. Hume studied at Edinburghwith Newtonian mathematicians, probably including Colin Maclauren (122in the key to Figure 10.1), who had extended Newton’s geometrical proofs andgotten his chair at Newton’s recommendation, and who led the Newtonian responseto Berkeley in 1742 (Kitcher, 1984: 232–240; Jesseph, 1993). Hume pickedup the theme of Berkeley’s attack; in the beginning of his Treatise he devotesconsiderable attention to arguing against the infinite divisibility of time and space(i.e., against the Maclauren-Newton position) and in favor of indivisible points,which must be matters of experience if they are to exist at all. He criticizes geometry(Maclauren’s specialty) as a science of no great certainty, since it must proceed viainduction from the senses, and concludes that all knowledge, including that ofmathematics, is only probable (Hume, [1739–40] 1969: 74–75, 176).1002 • Notes to Pages 609–61527. By the 1770s and 1780s, these included Hutton, whose geology overturned biblicalchronology, and Lord Monboddo, who produced early speculations on the evolutionof humans from the apes. Sources on the social history of Scotland (CMH,1902–1911: 6:117; Daiches, Jones, and Jones, 1986; Sher, 1985; Camic, 1983).28. Hume was only in his mid-twenties when he wrote his Treatise in the 1730s. Onceagain, age is important only as it coincides with structural opportunity.12. The German University Revolution1. These are Bergson, Dewey, Moore, Russell, Wittgenstein, Carnap, Husserl, andHeidegger; at least another 12 are in the running for secondary: Croce, Schlick,Meinong, Scheler, Cassirer, Rickert, McTaggart, Whitehead, Alexander, Santayana,G. H. Mead, and C. I. Lewis. For sources, see Chapter 10, notes 1 and 3. ComparingFigures 10.1 and 11.1, we see that the number of major philosophers inany one generation in Europe is never more than 3—a pattern in keeping with thatfor medieval Christendom, Islam, India, China, and Greece. By my standardmethod of ranking by amount of attention given in comprehensive histories, for1865–1900 the number of major philosophers is 5 (Peirce, James, Frege, Bradley,and Nietzsche). For secondary philosophers, the number calculated rises for 1835–1865 to 12, for 1865–1900 to 9, and 1900–1935 to 12. These numbers are ashigh as or higher than those for even the most active generations in all of pasthistory—the generation of 335–300 b.c.e. in Greece, when there were 8 secondaries,and 1265–1300 in medieval Christendom, when there were 9. It appears thatwe are gradually losing perspective on the fifth generation back from our own,that of 1835–1865, and almost certainly on the 1865–1900 generation. Within thenext few generations of our future, some of these major figures will fall to secondaryhistorical influence, and some secondaries to minor.Unlike earlier network figures in the book, those in Chapters 12–14 list everyoneby name and thus do not distinguish rankings by capitalization and key numbers.For convenience, what follows is a list of European philosophers ranked major (allcapitals) and secondary by generation: 1600: bacon, Suarez, Campanella, Herbertof Cherbury, Boehme, Grotius; 1635: descartes, hobbes, More, Cudworth, Arnauld,Mersenne, Gassendi, Pascal; 1665: spinoza, leibniz, locke, Malebranche,Bayle, Thomasius; 1700: berkeley, Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, Wolff, Vico; 1735:hume, rousseau, Voltaire, Montesquieu, d’Holbach, Diderot, d’Alembert, Condillac,Butler, Adam Smith, Reid; 1765: kant, fichte, Hamann, Lessing, Herder,Jacobi, Schiller, Paley, Bentham, Condorcet; 1800: schelling, hegel, schopenhauer,Schleiermacher, Herbart, Maine de Biran, Cousin, Saint-Simon; 1835: j. s.mill, Spencer, Huxley, Newman, Kierkegaard, Emerson, Comte, Renouvier, Marx,Engels, Lotze, Fechner, Boole; 1865: peirce, james, bradley, nietzsche, frege,Green, Bosanquet, Royce, Wundt, Mach, Brentano, Dilthey, von Hartmann, HermannCohen.2. In anglophone philosophy, the canonical reputations of Berkeley and Hume werenot established until the 1870s; until then Reid and Dugald Stewart were betterknown (Kaufmann, 1966: 277–278; Kuklick, 1984).Notes to Pages 615–621 • 10033. Intellectual movements in this respect resemble other social movements (Marwelland Oliver, 1993).4. Goethe on his travels in 1774 sought out Lavater, and it was on their voyagetogether down the Rhine, when Goethe was flushed with new fame from publishingWerther, that both first met Jacobi. The custom of the day was for travelers to visitthe famous, and conversely for famous travelers to be greeted by literary aspirantsalong the way. The pattern recurs throughout Goethe’s autobiography ([1811–32]1974).5. Herder, another friend of both sides of the network, took from Jacobi’s publicitythe cue to become an ardent Spinozaist. His Gott: Einige Gespräche (1787) rejectedKant as dry scientific rationalism and extolled the flowing impulses of nature asSpinozaist penetration by the infinite attributes of the divine (Zammito, 1992:243–245). Herder’s vitalist philosophy sounds superficially like Schelling’s Naturphilosophieof a decade later, except that the latter would perform the task withpost-Kantian tools: the synthetic a priori, the categories of the understanding, andthe dialectic of the transcendental self. Kant himself probably goaded his old pupilinto this split by his own review in 1784 of Herder’s Philosophie der Geschichteder Menschheit, in which he rejected on critical grounds Herder’s particularisticphilosophy of history.6. By 1802, publications on Kant numbered 2,832 items (Guyer, 1992: 449; Beiser,1987).7. About the same time, Fichte fell in love with a relative of the famous poetKlopstock. He eventually married her after the success of his book in 1793 madeit economically possible.8. In 1790 the French clergy were turned into elected civic functionaries; in 1794Christianity was replaced with an official Deist cult, complete with a new calendarbeginning with the Year One. The civic church lasted until Napoleon’s 1801Concordat with the pope restored Christianity as the state church.9. The atmosphere of Idealism, electrical science, and sexual liberation that surroundedSchelling is expressed in Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley’s Frankenstein,written in 1816 in a Swiss castle to entertain her companions Byron and Shelley.Mineralogy, another new field of scientific discovery, was also the site of Romanticspeculation; in the context of the time, it was not incongruous that the mostextreme member of the Romantic circle, Novalis, was a mining engineer. Swedenborgheld the same occupation in a previous generation.10. Born in 1770, Hegel did not make his independent mark until he was 37, with hisPhenomenology of Spirit. In contrast, Schelling (born in 1775) was precocious, afamous leader of Idealism by the age of 20, and progenitor of three differentsystems by age 28—a forcible illustration that what counts is not biological agebut time of centrality within the active network. Kant was a prolific publisher from1781 (age 57) through 1798 (age 74), the years when he was maximally energizedby being the center of attention.11. Hölderlin was finally recognized as one of the greatest German poets through theattention of Rilke and Stephan George after the complete edition of his works cameout in 1913.1004 • Notes to Pages 627–63612. The famous incident when Schopenhauer was sued for throwing a seamstress outof his anteroom occurred in Berlin in 1821, at just the time when it becameapparent that he would have no success lecturing in competition with Hegel(Safranski, 1989: 271–273).13. Arthur Schopenhauer is not the only one who was inducted into creativity by thesecontacts; his widowed mother, Johanna Schopenhauer, began to write essays andnovels in 1813, virtually simultaneously with Arthur’s philosophy, and became bythe 1820s the best-known woman writer in Germany. She had also hosted Mme.de Staël—the other famous woman writer of the day—when the latter was anémigrée from the French Revolution. The Schopenhauer family, heirs to a merchantfortune, nicely exemplify the investment of money in the single-minded pursuit ofcultural eminence: not as consumers, but for social contacts as means of culturalproduction.14. “If I am asked where the most intimate knowledge of that inner essence of theworld, of that thing in itself which I called the will to live, is to be found . . . thenI must point to the ecstasy in the act of copulation” (Schopenhauer’s journal,quoted in Safranski, 1989:269).15. Another distinctive strand in Schopenhauer’s cultural capital, the knowledge ofUpanishadic philosophy, which was just beginning to be translated in 1799–1802,was made available by his wide network contacts in the old Romanticist camp. Injust these years Friedrich Schlegel began to promote Sanskrit philology (1808), andAugust Schlegel in 1818 at Bonn occupied the first German chair of Indology(Halbfass, 1988: 63–107).16. Hegel’s immediate background was not particularly distinguished in comparisonto Schopenhauer’s: after leaving Jena in 1806, he had been a newspaper editor inBamberg for two years, headmaster of a Gymnasium at Nuremberg for eight years,finally becoming professor at Heidelberg in 1816 (succeeding Fries, who went toJena) two years before his invitation to Berlin (Gregory, 1989: 32–33; Kaufmann,1966: 227–230; Safranski, 1989: 252).17. In France, a mixture of various non-academic bases existed throughout the century.Voltaire and Rousseau, although popularized and eventually enriched by the newpublishing market, relied for material support during most of their lives on oldfashionedindividual patronage. Voltaire at one point also received some collectivepatronage at Frederick the Great’s academy. Montesquieu, Helvetius, d’Holbach,and Turgot were self-supporting aristocrats, although their intellectual interestswere shaped by contacts with the circles around the new publishing enterprises.On the publishing market in Germany and its associated careers, see Bruford(1965, 1962); Brunschwig (1947); Wuthnow (1989: 228–251).18. Johan Heilbron (1994: 26–46) shows that in France, where aristocratic salons inthe period from 1650 to 1790 brought together status-conscious courtiers with themost ambitious intellectuals, the hegemony of the literary style was taken to anextreme. The standards of polite and entertaining face-to-face conversation producedan emphasis on aphoristic wit and superficial cleverness of expression, anda denigration of sustained argument or erudition as pedantic. In this milieu, disdainfor the traditional university subjects was especially strong.Notes to Pages 636–640 • 100519. Sources on the movement to abolish the university (Lilge, 1948: 2–3; Schnabel,1959: 408–457; Weisz, 1983: 18). On German education and its reform (Paulsen,1919; Bruford, 1965; Brunschwig, 1947; Ben-David and Zloczower, 1962; Hammerstein,1970; Turner, 1974; McClelland, 1980; Mueller, 1987).20. The first educational administration independent of the church was founded inPrussia in 1787, a council composed of legal administrators, university professors,and rectors of the chief Latin schools. In 1794 the Prussian legal code made allschools and universities state institutions. The reforms in place by 1820 gave thephilosophical faculty a further career basis: teaching in a secondary school wasprofessionalized under the requirement of three years of university study in thephilosophical faculty. In the 1700s most secondary school teachers were theologystudents waiting for a pastorate to open up. Prussian reforms after 1787 simultaneouslyraised the pay of secondary teachers to the point where they could competewith pastorates (Mueller, 1987: 18–26).21. For example, the University of Berlin expanded from 28 chairs for full professorsin 1810–1819 to 115 chairs by 1909; total teaching staff expanded from 54 to540. In German universities as a whole, total faculty (including the ranks ofOrdinarius, Extraordinarius, and Privatdozent) grew from 890 in 1796, to 1,200in 1835, to 3,000 in 1905 (McClelland, 1980: 80, 258–259, 266).22. I put aside some cases which further complicate the argument. A few non-academicindividuals became famous in philosophy even after the academic revolution intheir nation: Schopenhauer, Marx, Nietzsche, Sartre, Camus. But most of thesewere academic hybrids, dropouts from academic careers (Sartre teaching in a lycéewas pursuing a typical French academic career, like that of Bergson). And wegenerally see in their work a shift back toward a literary mode, a de-differentiationof the intellectual role and a revolt against the technical level of philosophy alongwith this distancing from an academic base.23. Emerson’s network ties, before his creative work began in 1836, were literary:Goethe, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Carlyle. The Transcendentalists purveyed amélange of Goethesque pantheism, Plotinine emanationism, Platonic Ideas, and theadulation of geniuses such as Shakespeare. Kant was often invoked but his distinctionof critical versus dogmatic philosophy ignored; epistemological issues weredismissed in favor of direct intuition of higher Truth. The St. Louis Hegelians weremore rigorous but unoriginal in the fashion typical of idea importers. Their arenafor innovation was to apply the dialectic to current events. For example, in theCivil War, the slave-owning states represented “abstract right,” the North “abstractmorality,” and the victorious Union was Hegel’s ethical state (Pochmann, 1948:32).24. How then did earlier non-academic philosophers such as Descartes and Spinozacreate metaphysical systems? Generally speaking, it was against their expressedintentions. They were part of the scientific revolution, that is to say, the movementof rapid-discovery scientists which their general arguments were intended to justify.These intellectuals were unable to replace philosophy with science, because thevery act of arguing for the foundations of science, and any continuation of thesearguments by their successors, re-creates the turf of philosophy. Why thinkers like1006 • Notes to Pages 640–646Descartes stayed on the abstract level whereas the philosophes of the 1700s or theUtilitarians of the 1800s limited their issues to topical lay concerns, cannot beexplained by this aspect of their material bases, since all of them were non-academics.The thinkers of the 1600s were inwardly oriented toward their ownnetwork, especially the part of it which was carrying out the autonomous researchesof physical and mathematical science, whereas later non-academic philosopherswere much more lay-oriented because of their bases in popular literarymedia and political movements.25. “Religion on the strength of its sanctity, and law, on the strength of its majesty,try to withdraw themselves from [criticism]; but by so doing they arouse justsuspicions, and cannot claim that sincere respect which reason pays to those onlywho have been able to stand its free and open examination” (Kant, [1781] 1966:A.xi).26. “For if God actually spoke to man, man could still never know that it was Godspeaking. It is quite impossible for a man to apprehend the infinite by his senses,distinguish it from sensible beings, and recognize it as such” (Kant, [1798] 1991:115).27. A quasi-experimental validation of this point is the fate of the Karlsschule, foundedby the duke of Württemberg at Stuttgart in the early 1770s, and upgraded froma Gymnasium to a university in 1781 (DSB, 1981: 7:366–368; Schnabel, 1959:424). Here the culture was heavily secular, focusing on the Enlightenment programof practical sciences (especially medicine and public administration) plus vernacularlanguages. Its notable early graduates (all with medical training) included Schiller(posted as an army surgeon) and the biological scientists Cuvier and Kielmeyer.The Karlsschule was suppressed in 1794, at the height of educational failuresduring the crisis of the revolutionary wars. The structural weakness which itillustrated was that reform in too secular a direction eliminated the main careerattraction of the traditional university: its credentialing claim on careers in thechurch and in law, the two occupations on which the bureaucratizing state wasbuilding. The Enlightenment culture left education dangling too much on itspopular appeal to withstand shocks in material support.28. Kant was the son of a harness maker, who happened to grow up in a universitytown; Fichte, son of a poor ribbon peddler, was educated by the charity of aneighboring landowner; Herder, son of a schoolmaster, was so poor that Kantremitted his lecture fees; Schelling’s and Hölderlin’s fathers were pastors. Hegel’sfather was in the upper civil service of one of the small states, but Hegel too hadto find support as a tutor and secondary school teacher. The literary intellectuals,by contrast, were typically from wealthy families; they were much less dependenton low-paying academic or clerical careers, and had greater access to aristocraticconnections for becoming higher officials. Goethe, Jacobi, and Friedrich Schlegelwere university-educated in law, the faculty favored by aristocrats. Schopenhauer,the only one of the major Idealists who was independently wealthy, could affordto be a maverick; by the same token he was uninterested in educational or religiousreform.29. The very availability of tutoring jobs was due to the widespread unfashionablenessNotes to Pages 647–649 • 1007of formal education at this time. The leaders of educational reform all had personalexperience of one of the main alternative systems, and were strongly motivated toescape this alternative as a degradation of the autonomy of the teacher. The onlyremaining career path would have been to become a schoolmaster while waitingfor a pastorate to open up; such positions were extremely low paying and isolatedfrom most intellectual networks, whereas tutoring at least held out the possibilityof contact with cultivated circles of aristocratic or upper-bourgeois society.30. Despite periods of stagnation in enrollments, notably 1830–1860, in general theGerman university system was on a solid footing after 1810, quite the opposite ofits precarious position in the 1700s. Similarly, the criterion that professors’ careeradvancement depended on their research publications built up gradually, becomingdominant throughout Germany by around 1850 (Jarausch, 1982; McClelland,1980: 148, 171–172, 242–247).31. Success on Kant’s intellectual development (Beiser, 1992; Ameriks, 1992; Werkmeister,1980; Guyer, 1987). For positions and network details of the Wolffians,Pietists, and Berlin Academicians, see DSB (1981) and EP (1967).32. In his Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science (1786). Kant continued thisproject to the end of his life, leaving work from the early 1800s to be publishedposthumously (Friedman, 1992: 185–191, 199; Werkmeister, 1980: 101–128). Thematurity and validity of a science depended on how far it moved along this path.Kant held that chemistry, especially in the version of Stahl, presented only empiricalprinciples, not yet necessary ones; with the development of quantitative chemistryin the 1790s, Kant gave his endorsement to Lavoisier’s system.33. Fichte described the fundamental method of Idealism: “It shows that what is firstset up as fundamental principle and directly demonstrated in consciousness, isimpossible unless something else occurs along with it, and that this something elseis impossible unless a third something also takes place, and so on until theconditions of what was first exhibited are completely exhausted, and this latter is,with respect to its possibility, fully intelligible” (Fichte, [1794–1797] 1982: 25).34. “There is no need for premature alarm at the fact that this proposition expresslycontradicts the first principle . . . It is sufficient that this conclusion follows bycorrect inferences from established premises, no less than that which it contradicts.The ground of their unity will emerge in due time” (Fichte, [1794–1797] 1982:153; cf. pp. 98 and 226): “All contradictions are reconciled by more accuratedetermination of the propositions at variance; and so too here. The self must havebeen posited as infinite in one sense, and as finite in another.”35. Fichte’s own summary of “the essence of transcendental idealism” states: “Theconcept of existence is by no means regarded as a primary and original concept,but is viewed merely as derivative, as a concept derived, at that, through oppositionto activity, and hence is a merely negative concept. To the Idealist, the only positivething is freedom; existence, for him, is a mere negation of the latter” (Fichte,[1794–1797] 1982: 69). The identification of one’s personal self with freedom andwith the Eternal and Absolute is stressed particularly strongly in Fichte’s popularmanifesto The Vocation of Man, written in 1800 at the height of his identificationwith the Romantic movement. The theme was carried on by the other Idealists at1008 • Notes to Pages 650–656this time, such as in Schelling’s Philosophical Inquiries into the Nature of HumanFreedom (1809).36. The first history of philosophy to go beyond Greek models based on DiogenesLaertius and to give some attention to relatively recent philosophy was that ofBrucker (5 vols., 1742–1767) at Leipzig (EP, 1969: 6:227; Santinello, 1981).Brucker remained traditional in form, listing in parallel the opinions of variousschools rather than attempting to explain why philosophers had developed theirarguments. The first efforts to develop the chronological history of philosophicalideas coincided with the German university revolution: Tiedemann (6 vols., 1791–1797) at Marburg, and Tennemann (11 vols., 1789–1819) at Leipzig. Hegel drewon their pathbreaking work, while illustrating that one needs a philosophy of one’sown to write the history of philosophy in a philosophical manner. In Hegel, too,the emphasis shifts to a modern canonical sequence, rather than remaining preponderantlywith the Greeks. Hence Hegel shares with Aristotle, who made asimilar move in the historiography of ancient Greek philosophy, a focus on asynthesizing system mediating all the extremes, and on dynamic potential as theprime substance. On Hegel’s intellectual development, see Harris (1972, 1983,1993). Marx, who parallels Hegel in many ways during the following generation,also began by specializing in ancient philosophy, writing his dissertation on theEpicurean materialists.37. Hegel sets out the critique at the beginning of his system, in the Introduction tothe Phenomenology ([1807] 1967: 100–107), and repeats it in his Logic ([1812–1816] 1929: 2:251–252). Hegel is not unprecedented here; in the 1750s the PietistCrusius in polemics against the Wolffians had also rejected mathematics. Hegelclaims, more damningly as an academic modernist, that mathematical method inscience “belongs to a stage of mental culture that has now passed away” (Hegel,[1807] 1967: 106).38. Fries and Hegel had become Privatdozenten at Jena in 1801, leading to a publicationsrace in which Fries pulled ahead early. Fries got a chair at Heidelberg in 1805;this was later to be Hegel’s first chair, when Fries vacated it in 1816 to take theprofessorship at the old Jena center. Both competed for the Berlin job after Fichte’sdeath in 1814; but now in the period of growing conservatism, Fries’s activities inthe radical student movement got him into trouble with the authorities and madeHegel more acceptable.39. Schelling too had the pragmatic sense to abandon Naturphilosophie before its firstburst of enthusiasm in the early 1800s wore off, leaving the field for minor disciplesto exploit, himself moving into the more congenial humanistic field of comparativemythology.40. MacGregor (1992). Here again Hegel followed Fichte’s path, especially in thelatter’s quasi-socialist blueprint, The Closed Industrial State (1804).41. It is instructive to compare Spinoza, whose monist system bears some resemblanceto Idealist metaphysics. But Spinoza denied freedom of the will, while the Idealistsexalted it to a metaphysical extreme. It is not the surrounding political situationwhich makes the difference in these views. During Spinoza’s youth, the UnitedProvinces had won final recognition of its revolutionary struggle for independenceNotes to Pages 657–662 • 1009from Spain (1648), and the Dutch Republic in the 1660s and 1670s was the freeststate in the world. Spinoza’s own political activities were on behalf of freedom ofprivate religious belief, whereas the German Idealists were wresting control of theeducational system from the theologians and proselytizing the creative freedom ofthe philosophical faculty. The difference in the immediate organizational bases forintellectual life, rather than the political context as a whole, explains the divergentpositions on freedom in these philosophical systems.42. Sources on the history of English university reform (Rothblatt, 1981; Engel, 1982;Green, 1969; Richter, 1969); for international comparisons, see Rothblatt andWittrock (1993).43. Bradley sardonically expressed his attitude toward religious authority by parkinghis bicycle in the Merton College chapel; upon protest that it was desecrating theholy place, Bradley replied that he was willing to have it consecrated (Richter,1969: 36–38).44. To see bare particulars in the world is not primitive or simple, but an advancedaccomplishment resting on many intellectual distinctions. We ourselves, as well aschildren and animals, Bradley declares, first perceive universals. Even indexicals(“this,” “here”) are in some respect universals, words invocable across situations.To be sure, there is an indexically inexpressible aspect of every experience, but itresides not in the particularity of that moment, but in the fact that every “this”has for its subject reality as a whole; it is the whole which is indexical andinexpressible. Bradley hints at metaphysical consequences by pointing out that“this,” unlike other ideas, can never be a symbol of something else. If we couldfind all ideas whose contents cannot be used as adjectives of something else, thiswould open the way to a new Anselmian ontological proof (Bradley, [1883] 1922:27, 35, 69, 98).45. A foreign member was William James, who founded the American Society forPsychical Research in 1884, during the time when he was working on his psychology.Peirce and Royce participated in the 1880s and 1890s in research on hauntedhouses and table turning (Myers, 1986: 11; Brent, 1993: 209, 215, 223).46. Bradley’s Logic (1883: 53–55) had started a somewhat similar argument: the fictionof the atomic now is due to the combination of presence (two events marked assimultaneous) plus existence (a real appears in the time series, but is not in time).Bradley concluded that presence is the negation of time. For Bradley, time is mereappearance, and there may be any number of time-sequence equivalents in theAbsolute.47. It was formulated in the Gifford Lectures, 1916–1918, and published in 1920 asSpace, Time, and Deity. Whitehead’s Process and Reality (1929) was from theGifford Lectures for 1926–1928. James’s Varieties of Religious Experience wasfrom the lectures for 1902. The Gifford Lectures on Natural Religion, endowedat the Scottish theological strongholds of Edinburgh and Glasgow, were a principalpromoter of Idealist philosophy.48. Russell (1967). Perhaps because German Idealism was acquiring a bad name underthe influence of Russell’s polemics, Whitehead pretended that his system was adevelopment of themes in the classical tradition from Descartes to Locke and1010 • Notes to Pages 664–671Hume; in fact Whitehead’s discussion of these thinkers largely focuses on the flawsof their sensationism and intellectualism. Leibniz, the thinker whom he most closelyresembles, receives relatively few explicit references. Whitehead and Alexander ineffect recapitulate the positions of Leibniz and Spinoza in terms of twentieth-centuryscientifically oriented Idealism.49. A phenomenon noted for all historical periods by sociologists of religion (Starkand Bainbridge, 1985; Finke and Stark, 1992).50. Kuklick (1977: 135–136; 234–235). Royce had come as a graduate student toHopkins from Berkeley, where Gilman had been president before Hopkins; he wasintroduced to Idealism by Hopkins’s G. S. Morris, who also taught John Dewey.During the customary sojourn in Germany, Royce studied with Lotze, Wundt, andWindelband. Characteristically for the Americans of this period, his own philosophywas more Idealist than that of his German professors.51. James’s changing disciplinary identification may be traced in his successive titles:assistant professor of physiology in 1876, assistant professor of philosophy in1880, and professor in 1885; professor of psychology in 1889; back to professorof philosophy in 1897 (Boring, 1950: 510–511).52. For this reason Peirce regarded mathematics as the investigation of the consequencesof hypotheses; he himself innovated mathematical notation similar to thework of Dedekind and Cantor (DSB, 1981: 10:484).53. Buchler (1955: 354, 356). Peirce pointed out that an infinite regress results whenone attempts to analyze certain kinds of relations: a statement of relation mustalways characterize the relation of relations to their subjects, and so on. Theargument parallels Bradley, except that from Peirce’s mathematical viewpoint, suchnested series of relations fit the definition of the continuum “as that in which everypart is of the same nature as the whole” (EP, 1967: 6:76).54. Brent (1993: 311, 300, 209); Buchler (1955: 323). Eisele (DSB, 1981: 10:485)summarizes: “Nature syllogizes, making inductions and abductions.”55. This is confirmed by the pattern of the various European analogues to pragmatism.In Germany, Mach interpreted scientific laws as practical fictions; and indeed Jamesmet and admired Mach during a visit to the Continent in 1882, long beforeformulating his own pragmatist doctrine (Johnston, 1972: 181). Vaihinger’s Philosophyof As-If (1911) similarly resonates with James. But the aims are quitedifferent from James’s religious concerns. Mach’s positivism is purely scientific, andVaihinger is a Neo-Kantian concerned with the validity of the forms of experiencein the absence of a thing-in-itself. Pragmatism never became a self-consciousmovement in Germany as it was in the United States. In the German universityorbit the generations of Idealists had long since passed, and there was no demandfor such a stepping-stone between religious Idealism and secularism. Where we dofind the analogue to the United States is in Italy, where a pragmatist movement,led by Calderoni, arose soon after the zenith of Idealism. Here the timing was likethat in America: the university system was under reform, as secularizers wrestedit from the hands of the church and installed a German-style educational system.The Italian pragmatists were a halfway house between positivism and Idealism,criticizing both schools while borrowing elements from both.Notes to Pages 672–678 • 101156. Peirce’s 1868 argument resonates both with his semiotic chains and with the latermaneuvers of Idealists such as Royce. Peirce holds that Cartesian doubt is animpossibility; whereas Royce concludes that a larger Self is behind the activity ofdoubting, Peirce specifies that the very thoughts in which the doubt is formulatedare composed of signs, whose meaning is in the system of signs and in the socialcommunity which uses them.57. Peirce’s life is often depicted as a melodrama illustrating the moralistic prejudicesof his day and the failure of America to honor genius. Alternatively, Brent (1993)gives a reductionist explanation for Peirce’s career difficulties as the result ofchronic neuralgia, which drove him to drugs, and in turn to episodes of financialand professional irresponsibility, outbursts of anger, and violence against his wivesand servants. Yet it appears that Peirce’s episodic afflictions, like his propensity forpersonal conflicts, coincided with times of uncertainty and strain in his intellectualcareer; he himself finally recognized that his sicknesses were set off emotionally byadversity (Brent, 1993: 294). A more sociological interpretation is that Peirce’snetwork position gave him high ambitions and resources, but placed insuperableobstacles in the way of creating a clear-cut intellectual position.58. Peirce was another of Dewey’s teachers, whose energy must have given someindication of what could be done at the interface of Idealism and science; butPeirce’s formal semiotic did not favorably impress the unmathematical Deweyat all.59. Experimental psychology in its academic origins stressed the overlap of physiologyand philosophy because the discipline was created by the migration of medicalphysiologists into philosophy chairs—James in the United States, Wundt in Germany—motivated by the shortage of positions in science faculties and the surplusof positions in philosophy (Ben-David and Collins, 1966). Most American psychologistsof this generation had been sojourning pupils of Wundt.60. Ruckmick (1912). The first independent psychology department in the world wasfounded by G. Stanley Hall, Dewey’s old mentor, at Clark University in 1889. InGermany experimental psychologists, ensconced in philosophy departments in auniversity system which was no longer differentiating new chairs, never developedbehaviorism, but continued the philosophical focus on consciousness with introspectionistpsychology (1870s–1910) and then Gestalt psychology (1910s). Iexamine the origins of experimental psychology within the German universitysystem in Chapter 13.13. The Post-revolutionary Condition1. Kline (1972: 623). The point was repeated as late as 1810 by Delambre, secretaryof the mathematics and physics section of the Institut de France.2. Abel had five papers in the first issue of Crelle’s journal (including his resolutionof the long-standing puzzle of the general solution of quintic equations), andGalois’s general theory of the solvability of algebraic equations by means of thetheory of groups appeared in Liouville’s journal in 1846.3. Practicing mathematicians, such as Euler, Lagrange, and Gauss, did occasionally1012 • Notes to Pages 679–699attempt to clarify disreputable issues such as divergent series (Boyer, 1985: 562,566), but as an exploration of particular issues rather than a general methodologicalconcern.4. This helps explain why innovations in basic axiomatic systems now came fromschoolteachers on the periphery of the mathematical world, such as Lobachevskyin Russia, Bolyai in Hungary, and Grassmann while teaching at a German Gymnasium.I explore this further in the section on England, “The Advantages ofProvinciality.”5. This is not to say that physical interpretations of non-Euclidean geometry werenot offered; for example, elliptic geometry can be considered the geometry of asurface of a sphere. Gauss around 1820 attempted to measure angles amongmountain peaks in order to test which geometry fit (Kline, 1972: 867–880).Non-Euclidean geometry was more a flashpoint of public recognition than anunderlying shift in the way mathematicians worked. N-dimensional geometries,which had been used occasionally in purely technical manipulations by d’Alembertand Lagrange, broke the connection with the physical world even more decisivelyby the 1840s. Older mathematicians such as Gauss had anticipated some of theseconceptions by following out pathways available in existing mathematical practice;but they failed to see the potential significance because they were still operating ina frame of reference, grounded in the lack of differentiation between mathematicsand scientific application, in which mathematical concepts must have intuitivemeaning. Gauss’s unwillingness to publish many of his ideas, in contrast withCauchy’s ambitious rush into print in the new attention space of pure math, showsthe key part the social context plays in selecting ideas from an unfocused backgroundand putting them into the center of attention.6. All categorical propositions are to be analyzed into propositions asserting ordenying existence; “all men are mortal” becomes “an immortal man does notexist,” and “all triangles have 180 degrees” becomes “there exists no triangle thatdoes not have 180 degrees” (Johnston, 1972: 292–293; Lindenfeld, 1980: 48–53).7. This parallels Brentano’s doctrine, developed around the same time, that the mindintends objects; the object in general is, so to speak, a slot to be filled with particularobjects. In Brentano, the doctrine is mixed with empirical psychology; Husserl, anetwork offshoot of both Brentano and Frege, extracts from their concepts ageneral phenomenology.8. To put it another way: an entire functional statement may be taken as content fora second-order statement; thus, existence may be treated as a second-order concept,but it is invalid to collapse the levels and treat them as an attribute of a first-orderconcept within the nested statements. This is the error Descartes made when heargued that divinity implies existence just as the concept of a triangle implies truthsabout its angles. In the same way, the universal quantifier (“all”) is a second-orderconcept whose complexities are hidden in ordinary language (Kneale and Kneale,1984: 504; Coffa, 1991: 73).9. This is the Leibnizian problem of identity of indiscernibles again. Frege points outthat it cannot be solved by distinguishing different positions in space or time, sincethe issue arises once again in this context.Notes to Pages 699–702 • 101310. Cantor originated the method of one-to-one correspondence; Cantor’s concept ofthe power or cardinal number of a set is similar to Frege’s Platonic object-numbers.11. Here Frege converges rather surprisingly with Bradley, who also held in his verydifferent logic of 1883 that all true statements are about a single object, theuniverse. The British Idealist and the German logical formalist pursue a similarpath insofar as they are rebounding off a common enemy, empiricist logic in themanner of J. S. Mill.12. When the full-blown logicist movement widened the search for predecessors,Bolzano was also added retrospectively to the pantheon. Beginning in the 1810sas a mathematician-philosopher in the pre-disciplinary mode of an old-fashioneduniversity (Prague) on the periphery of the German system, Bolzano set out torefute Kant with a combination of Leibnizian metaphysics and infinitesimal calculus(Coffa, 1991: 26–32; Boyer, 1985: 564–566). The result included variousdistinctions resembling those of Frege and his successors. Bolzano was ignored,owing in part to his isolation in the networks of the time; his work lacked thedrive to omni-symbolism which became the mark of the later movement, and hisinnovations were buried in a metaphysical system of archaic cast. As in other caseswhere adumbrations were recognized only in retrospect, Bolzano points up theimportance of a full-scale intellectual movement to raise details from their surroundingsand focus attention on them as landmarks of a new worldview.13. Almost simultaneously, in 1844 Grassmann produced an even wider generalizationof complex numbers, connected to n-dimensional geometry, and dropping not onlythe commutative but also the associative law. Grassmann’s work was little recognizeduntil the 1860s. The difference in fame was due to the fact that Hamilton’swork came as the climax of controversy around the fundamentals of Britishmathematics; whereas Grassmann was working in a side area far from the topicson which German and French mathematicians were focusing attention. Grassmannoriginated not in the network of leading German mathematicians, but as a theologypupil of Schleiermacher. Under prevailing conceptions of mathematics, such nonnaturalisticinnovations were likely seen in a theological rather than a strictlymathematical context. Hamilton too had German Idealist connections as an intimateof Coleridge; he claimed quaternions had cosmic rather than merely mathematicalsignificance (Hankins, 1980).14. Sir William Hamilton and Bolzano (see note 12) are structural parallels: both werephilosophical conservatives at provincial universities who found their stimulus inopposing the influx of fashionable Kantianism. In both cases fundamental innovationsin logic were set in motion in the 1830s which were not recognized untillater.15. Again in 1863 Mill was to promote his systematic philosophy by using Sir WilliamHamilton as a foil. Hamilton was especially well known in America, where Scottishfaculty psychology dominated the colleges; there he became the subject of discussionsfrom which emerged yet another innovation in logic, that of Peirce in the1870s. As we saw in Chapter 12, Peirce’s starting point in mathematics, via hisfather’s work, was an extension of Cayley and Sylvester’s method for inventing1014 • Notes to Pages 703–707alternative algebras, which they had generalized from Hamilton’s quaternions.Peirce was an American import of British mathematical and philosophical networks,who brought together their controversies into a full-fledged system.16. There is even a personal connection to the core of the Utilitarians: John Stuart Millwas Russell’s godfather. This could hardly have produced any direct intellectual oremotional influence, since Mill died when Russell was one year old. But it exemplifieshow central Russell was in the late Victorian network structure, a fact whichmust have shaped his intellectual trajectory. He was raised by his grandparents,Lord Russell, the introducer of the Reform Bill in 1832 and subsequent primeminister, and Lady Russell, an outspoken political liberal and promoter of Utilitariancauses.17. Kline (1972: 1031–33). At this time Whitehead was purely a mathematician; hisshift into philosophy did not occur until the 1920s.18. Kline (1972: 1197–1208; DSB, 1981: 14:613–616; Peckhaus, 1990). Zermelo’sbasic idea, showing the existence of relations by which every set in an infinitesystem corresponds to one of its elements, was already formulated in 1900–1901lectures. It burst into prominence in 1904 in the aftermath of Russell and in tandemwith Hilbert’s announcement of his formalist program. This was the formalistnetwork in action; Zermelo was a Dozent at Göttingen, a colleague of Hilbert andHusserl, and a former pupil at Halle of Cantor, whose set theory Zermelo defended.At the same moment, Hilbert proposed his drastic new program to cure mathematicalparadoxes, including these newest ones, by treating mathematical symbolsas nothing more than arbitrary but consistent sets of marks on paper. Dramaticdevelopments of this kind are not mysterious and sudden insights. Typically theyhappen in the course of long and intense concentration on problems focused bynetwork conflicts. In this case Russell found his paradox, and Zermelo his axiomof choice, by wrestling with dubious points in Cantor’s system. Russell describeshow he tried out every conceivable approach to his problems, just as W. R.Hamilton discovered quaternions in a sudden insight after 15 years of working onthe problem (Coffa, 1991: 103, 115; Kline, 1972: 779).19. Wedberg (1984: 139–141). Because of his emphasis on the independence of logicalelements, Russell for a while endorsed Meinong’s 1904 doctrine of the types ofreality of all mental and extra-mental objects. Russell could vacillate amongvarious forms of realism—Platonist, sensory, and others—because his principle ofacquaintance covered very generally every kind of item that might be directlyknown.20. Wittgenstein also rejects Neo-Kantianism, which he otherwise somewhat resembles.The space-form is not merely a kind of spectacles through which we see theworld; it involves a “multiplicity of relations” which we have had to discoverthrough exploration of uses of symbol systems (Tractatus 4.0412). Wittgensteinseems to have in mind that a fact such as space having three dimensions ratherthan something else is not explained by Neo-Kantian a priority; logic permeatesthe world, including its “empirical” aspects.21. Russell himself, who declared that his brain had been burned out by the struggleNotes to Pages 709–717 • 1015to break through old gestalts in the theory of types, had an inkling of the importanceof symbolism in Wittgenstein’s breakthrough (Russell, 1967: 228–229, 247).Referring to Wittgenstein’s notion of unsayability, in the introduction to the Tractatus(Russell, 1922: xvii–xviii) Russell says: “This view may have been originallysuggested by notation, and if so, that is much in its favor, for a good notation hasa subtlety and suggestiveness which at times makes it seem almost like a liveteacher. Notational irregularities are often the first sign of philosophical errors, anda perfect notation would be a substitute for thought.”22. Frege had already shown the way in pointing out that his distinction betweenasserting a function and the content asserted—a predecessor of the hierarchictheory of types—reveals the error in Anselm’s ontological proof.23. “Vienna Circle” is a loose term for an entire movement. In the narrower sense, thecircle was the personal seminar conducted by Schlick from 1924 to 1936; asthe movement grew, it became formalized through the leadership of Neurath withits manifesto in 1929 and its own journal, Erkenntnis, in 1930 (Ayer, 1982;Popper, 1976; Quine, 1985; Waismann, 1979; Johnston, 1972). Overlapping wereother sub-factions and discussion groups, as well as a pared-down circle of thoseWittgenstein allowed to meet with him during 1927–1932. These circles areinterconnected by visitors with the Berlin circle of Reichenbach, and with theWarsaw school of logicians; another node at Prague via the physicist Philip Frank,becoming more central when Carnap gets a chair there in 1931; and in the 1930sa widening network of young philosophers who spread the message abroad: fromOxford, Ryle’s pupil Ayer; from Harvard, Whitehead’s and C. S. Lewis’s pupil (andthereby James’s grandpupil) Quine.24. Schnädelbach (1984: 87); Willey (1978: 155, 173); Johnston (1972: 189). Vaihingerbegan to formulate his doctrine in the 1870s after studying with the militantNeo-Kantian Lange. Vaihinger was strongly identified with Kantian scholarship;he founded the journal Kant Studien in 1896 and the Kant Society in 1904, themajor channels for the proliferation of Kantian publications at the turn of thecentury. It was in this journal that Schlick delivered his attack on Cassirer’sNeo-Kantian physics in 1921. The Vienna Circle journal Erkenntnis was a successorto another of Vaihinger’s journals, Annalen der Philosophie.25. Coffa (1991: 189–201). Einstein overthrew Newtonian space as an absolute containerof motion; as late as 1920, Reichenbach regarded Einstein’s argument asproviding support for Neo-Kantianism. Einstein himself came to dislike the Neo-Kantian interpretation, holding instead that time-space has physically objectiveexistence. In 1921 Einstein wrote to Schlick in support of the latter’s critique ofCassirer’s interpretation of relativity theory. But Einstein’s opinion was hardlydecisive for the changing philosophical atmosphere. His own sympathies weremixed and highly variable (Holton, [1973] 1988: 237–278). Early (around 1905)Einstein regarded himself as sympathetic to Machian phenomenalism, thoughdrawing crucial components from Planck’s opposing position; in the 1910s heshifted toward theory-accessible realism; by 1922—just after his contact withSchlick—he was publicly attacking the Machians as overly empiricist. When the1016 • Notes to Pages 717–720Vienna Circle was developing in the 1920s, Einstein was going in the oppositedirection. The fact is Einstein’s special relativity was taken as support by all themajor philosophical positions alike: Neo-Kantian, positivist, realist, pragmatist,and even religious Idealist.26. We have seen this in the endless critiques by ancient Greek Academics pointing outcontradictions in the doctrines of Stoics, and in the imperviousness of Epicureansto attack. In ancient India the Ajivikas were ridiculed for their inconsistencybetween believing in all-encompassing Fate and their personal striving for liberation.In medieval India the Nyaya-Vaisheshika school responded to acute Buddhistand Advaita attacks on paradoxes in their position not by backing away from theirrealism but by extending it. These schools lasted many generations without changingtheir positions.27. Popper states in his autobiography that he had had the basic idea already in 1919,as the result of disgust with Marxist politics and the enthusiastic claims of theFreudian and Adlerian psychoanalytic factions. This was at about the same timeSchlick was invoking falsification against the Neo-Kantians; but neither Schlicknor Popper made much further use of the idea in these years. Popper’s family andpersonal connections brought him in contact with a wide range of the avant-gardepolitical, musical, and social science movements in Vienna during the 1920s; theseconnections also kept his career interests scattered until 1930, when he began tofocus on developing the philosophical implications of a falsification criterion interms of the debates that were now splitting the Vienna Circle. Although heretrospectively portrays himself as the destroyer of logical positivism, Popperbecame famous through his connection with the Vienna Circle (Popper, 1976:36–38, 78–90, 107).28. Kuhn’s originating network overlaps with that of Quine: both were members ofthe Harvard Society of Junior Fellows, and early in their careers both werepersonally connected to Conant, who built up the program in history of scienceat Harvard. Kuhn’s work is the best-known result of the confluence of two majororganizational developments: the differentiation of the academic discipline of historyof science, together with the foundation-of-science issues generated by crossdisciplinaryborder flows of mathematics and physics into philosophy which constitutedthe Vienna Circle.29. Moore however remained oblivious to the revolt against the subject-predicate formbeing carried out by Frege and Russell; small wonder Wittgenstein despised thebook.30. See the genealogical charts in Levy (1981: 22–25); Bell (1972: xviii–xix). There isnothing to match this elsewhere. In Germany, Brentano came from a family offamous writers, and Fichte’s son had some reputation among theological Idealists;but in general German linkages are purely academic ones. In America, James andPeirce were born into families of famous intellectuals, but overall the intellectualnetwork has few kinship ties. Nor were British philosophers usually tied togetherby kinship, except in these few generations. Under previous conditions, mostintellectuals were either celibate clerics or recipients of patronage in aristocraticNotes to Pages 720–732 • 1017households who could not afford to marry; after the Humboldtian universityrevolution, professors were middle-class specialists segregated in alliance networksby their careers.31. For instance, in his Introduction to Wittgenstein’s Tractatus, (1922: xxii) Russellcomments: “As one with long experience of the difficulties of logic and of thedeceptiveness of theories which seem irrefutable, I find myself unable to be sure ofthe rightness of a theory, merely on the ground that I cannot see any point onwhich it is wrong.”32. The doctrine of Stevenson (Quine’s pupil) that ethical statements are emotionalexpressions (1944) had a similar effect in the United States.33. Mauthner, who explored the philosophy of language during Wittgenstein’s youthin Vienna, is sometimes regarded as an early influence or predecessor. Nevertheless,Mauthner’s “critique of language” did not set the pathway Wittgenstein followedfrom mathematical logic into a theory of propositions. The case of Mauthnershows that the philosophical resonances of language were noticed from time totime—as is to be expected in the increasing consciousness of symbol systems infields ranging from Neo-Kantianism to Freud. The movement to turn all of philosophyinto the study of ordinary language was a more specific and militant movewithin the philosophical discipline, and that is where its structural causes are found.34. Wittgenstein was merely an undergraduate at Cambridge during his period ofdiscipleship with Russell, never took a formal degree, although he was given aPh.D. pro forma upon returning in 1929. Russell and Moore also had enoughindependent wealth (and, especially in the case of Russell, social eminence) todedicate themselves to their intellectual interests, even during periods withoutacademic support. Wittgenstein made ostentatious gestures of despising materialwealth, for instance, keeping no furniture in his college rooms during the 1930s,so that his pupils had to bring their own chairs. It was the kind of sacrifice ofwealth for status of which the satiated rich are capable; in a more conventionalversion, Wittgenstein cultivated entrée with the artistic elite upon his return toVienna in 1914 by donating a large amount of money to them (Monk, 1990: 109).Something of the same self-confident eliteness was expressed in Russell’s insouciantstyle. At the age of 27 he could treat the famous mathematician Poincaré in debateas follows: “M. Poincaré requests a definition . . . Perhaps he will be shocked if Itell him that one is not entitled to make such a request since everything that isfundamental is necessarily indefinable . . . Since mathematicians almost invariablyignore the role of definitions, and since M. Poincaré appears to share their disdain,I will allow myself a few remarks on this topic” (Coffa, 1991: 130). Russell’spolemical style was a form of mocking, often with an undertone of class consciousness,as when he derided the Idealist conception of sensory experience as parts ofa whole by imagining the professor calling his college servant to testify what the“plain man” thinks: “Well, sir, greenness is to me the name of a complex fact, thefactors of which essentially and reciprocally determine one another. And if you,sir, choose to select one factor out of the complex, and to call it greenness, I willnot dispute about the term, for I know my place, sir” (Coffa, 1991: 96).35. The organizational setting too played a role. Göttingen had been the main center1018 • Notes to Pages 734–738for programs of unification in mathematics since Riemann’s generalization ofnon-Euclidean geometries in the 1850s; Klein’s unification of geometry around thetheory of groups and their invariants beginning in the 1870s and developing intoan encyclopedic movement at Göttingen from 1886 until 1913; and Hilbert’sefforts at formal unification of vast areas of mathematics at the turn of the century(DSB, 1981: 7:396–397; Paukert, 1990). Husserl created an even broader programto unify science on its most general basis.36. Lipps was a former pupil of Stumpf, and thus another network grandpupil ofBrentano, whose act-psychology Lipps’s position resembled. Lipps was known forhis theory of empathy, as the active project of the self into external objects. Hispsychological version of phenomenology was upstaged by the more radical objectbracketingphenomenology of Husserl.37. Though publicly supportive of Scheler, Husserl referred to his work privately as“fool’s gold”; later he would call Scheler and Heidegger his “antipodes” (Spiegelberg,1982: 269).38. Heidegger overdramatized the extent to which the question of being had beenforgotten since the time of Duns Scotus. In fact, it had become a hot issue amonghis own immediate network predecessors. Husserl bracketed the question of beingin order to study essences; Meinong multiplied the kinds of being. Heidegger tookthe opposite direction from his teacher’s rival, searching for the univocal meaningof being underlying all varieties.39. From Husserl’s viewpoint this was a merely naturalistic use, which he neverthelessencouraged when meeting Jaspers in 1913. At this point Husserl was still lookingfor allies (Natanson, 1973: 160). A key network contact in Jaspers’s developmentwas Erich Frank, a pupil of Rickert and Windelband, who in 1914 discovered thevirtually unknown Kierkegaard and shared this enthusiasm with Jaspers. In 1919Frank’s Wissen, Wollen, Glauben, along with Jaspers’s Psychologie der Weltanschauungen,launched German existentialism (EP, 1967: 3:218–219). By 1923,Heidegger was personally acquainted with Jaspers.40. In the pattern typical of creative groups, the personal relationships had formedbefore either of them did the creative work which made them famous. Out of thissame period came a generation of younger scholars later to be famous in Germanthought: Heidegger’s assistants Gadamer, Löwith, and Marcuse. Another ofHusserl’s assistants, Oscar Becker, forms the intermediary link as teacher of Apeland Habermas (Gadamer, 1985: 141, 171).41. In the 1960s and again in the 1980s, there were controversies over Heidegger’sinvolvement with Nazism in the early 1930s (Bourdieu, [1975] 1991; Farias, 1987).None of these makes a convincing case that Heidegger’s politics determined hisphilosophy. Bourdieu’s analysis, the most sociological, rests on the assertion thatthe intellectual field is homologous to the surrounding social and political field.Hence Heidegger did not need to be conscious that he was expressing in theconcepts specific to the philosophical field the same stance of the resentful provincialmiddle class which gave rise to Nazism in the political field. But in fact theintellectual field is not homologous to the social and political world; the one isgoverned by the struggle for attention under the law of small numbers, with itsNotes to Pages 742–748 • 1019limit of a half dozen effective factions and its structural pressures for oppositionsand regroupings; whereas the social and political worlds do not operate by thiskind of struggle over attention space, and do not have the same numbers of factionsand oppositions. Bourdieu posits a further homology between the factions withinphilosophy and the structure of relations within the intermediate level constitutingthe academic field of the universities in general. Nevertheless, the overcrowdingof candidates for faculty positions after 1900, and a huge influx of students inthe 1920s (Bourdieu, [1975] 1991: 123, citing Ringer, 1969), are not phenomenaunique in the history of modern education, and do not account for the range ofopposing positions in philosophy of this time. Similar overcrowding occurred inthe 1830s and 1840s, but the result was not anti-modernist conservatism butthe radicalism of the Young Hegelians (Toews, 1980: 213–216, 1993: 389–392;McClelland, 1980). The external resonances of Heidegger’s philosophy were notspecific to (or even primarily with) the Nazis; its greatest popularity was amongProtestant and Catholic theologians, and among the French existentialists of theanti-Nazi underground, and it received its widest fame in France in the yearsimmediately after the liberation. The attempts to discredit Heidegger by means ofhis Nazi phase are part of the intellectual maneuvers of a later period.42. Husserl followed Kant in taking time as the basic form of experience, since allexperience is temporal but not spatial. For Kant, all categories are configurationsof time: substance is permanence through time; causality is lawful succession intime; and so on. But in this Kantian approach, being itself is not temporal. Husserlkept changing his mind as to whether time flows from the pre-temporal transcendentalego or vice versa, or indeed whether subjectivity and temporality areidentical (Dostal, 1993: 147–149).43. There is an additional reason why Heidegger reverses Husserl’s position. Husserlidentified being with the naturalistic level, distinguishing being from the essencesrevealed by bracketing. Heidegger’s being is univocal across all levels; therefore heeliminates bracketing.44. The intermediary between Schutz and Husserl was Felix Kaufmann, a Viennesewhose interests in mathematics, physics, and economics were fostered in theperiphery of the Vienna Circle. Kaufmann had visited Husserl from 1922 on, andintroduced Schutz to him in 1932. Schutz, an economist, took up the phenomenologicalmethod in order to clarify debates over the foundations of socialscience, and especially Max Weber’s categories of verstehen and rational action.Schutz’s followers, like the later phenomenologists in general, became known asviolent antagonists of the logical positivists. Not uncharacteristically in the growthof intellectual movements, opposing movements tend to split off from a commoncenter: in the network, Schutz is only two links away from Schlick, Carnap, andvon Mises. Harold Garfinkel, a pupil of Schutz at the New School for SocialResearch in New York during the early 1950s, went on to develop the sociologicalresearch program of ethnomethodology, inventing methods for breaching thetaken-for-grantedness of everyday life which are something like experimentalequivalents of the phenomenological epochê. Garfinkel’s movement in U.S. sociologyduring the 1960s and 1970s resurrected some qualities of Heidegger’s preach-1020 • Notes to Page 749ing, emphasizing the moral resonances of uncovering the merely constructed natureof the social world while pessimistically recognizing the inevitability of such constructions.45. It was this phase of Heidegger that gave him a philosophical point of contact—apart from whatever temporizing and bandwagon jumping was involved—forgreeting the Nazi rise to power in 1933.46. Projecting this back into medieval Christendom, William of Ockham is supposedto be a typical Anglo philosopher, but Duns Scotus is not; in fact both of theseBritons spent most of their careers in France and Germany. The archetypal metaphysician,Saint Anselm, was archbishop of Canterbury.47. Hoch (1991) suggests that the Vienna Circle shifted from a militant program ofreplacing philosophy with unified science to a reforming movement within philosophybecause of their migration to the United States. At this time their base shiftedpredominantly from physics chairs to philosophy departments. Carnap’s chair atPrague had been in philosophy, but it was housed, unusually, in the natural sciencefaculty; as in Vienna, the philosophy chairs had been split into one for inductivescience or natural philosophy, another for traditional humanistic philosophy. Theorganizational background of the Vienna Circle was a European movement toabsorb philosophy academically into the natural sciences. Nothing like this existedin the United States or Britain. Hence when the Vienna Circle migrated, it had toaccommodate, becoming a reform movement within academic philosophy andeventually a technical specialty among others.48. This may be one reason why Wittgenstein—apart from his usual cantankerousness—refused to go along with the Vienna Circle’s condemnation of Heidegger(Janik and Toulmin, 1973: 288).14. Writers’ Markets and Academic Networks1. Sources on the institutional structure of French education (CMH, 1902–1911:8:52, 752; 9:126–129; 10:73–93; 11:23–26, 297; 12:92–93, 114–118; Weisz,1983; Fabiani, 1988; Burrage, 1993; Ringer, 1992).2. Politician-philosophers included not only the Idéologues but also Royer-Collard,who led the “Doctrinaires” faction, deriving politics from immutable self-evidentprinciples (in fact taken largely from the Scottish philosophy of Reid, who heldagainst Hume that man has a faculty of common sense); on the conservative side,de Maistre and de Bonald with their self-conscious traditionalism; Mme. de Staël,the daughter of the pre-Revolutionary finance minister, and emblem of the vacillatingloyalties of the Royalist exiles; and Chateaubriand, like Destutt and Mainede Biran a former army officer, prominent after 1800 in the politics of Royalistopposition to Napoleon. Chateaubriand made his reputation in 1802 with hisGenius of Christianity, written in opposition to Cabanis. The emergence of thepolitical assemblies as the focus of attention went along with an underlying shiftin the bases of intellectual production in the Revolutionary/Napoleonic period.3. For instance, he was pictured on the cover of Time magazine in 1946 while on apublicity tour of the United States (Cohen-Solal, 1987: 271). The nearest approachNotes to Pages 750–764 • 1021to such publicity would have been Kant, who was widely discussed in Germanmagazines of the late 1780s; but the large-scale mass media did not exist yet inthe twentieth-century sense. Sartre was the equivalent in philosophy of the publicitywhich elevated into media figures, among scientists, Einstein in the 1920s, andamong writers, Hemingway in the 1940s. Within France, André Malraux hadachieved some of this standing of front-page publicity in the 1930s with his exoticadventure-cum-writing exploits (Lacouture, 1975).4. We see the same thing again with Sartre, whose first major production, Nausea,takes its surface content from his own situation as a provincial lycée teacher in LeHavre.5. Deussen became a pupil of Zeller, and thus connects Nietzsche indirectly to themain Hegel network (Figure 13.1). Pforta had been Fichte’s secondary school aswell. A younger schoolmate of Nietzsche, Ulrich Wilamowitz-Moellendorf, wholater became the preeminent classicist of his day (and grandteacher of the hermeneuticphilosopher Gadamer), made his first statement by critiquing Nietzsche’sBirth of Tragedy of 1872. Pforta was in fact the only Gymnasium which offereda truly elite curriculum in the 1850s–1870s; it selected most of its students forscholarships, and more than 30 of its pupils went on to become full professors atGerman universities, including Liebmann (originator of Neo-Kantianism) andPaulsen (Mueller, 1987: 29). Nietzsche was a product of the cutting edge ofeducation in the German school system.6. Although Nietzsche hated the anti-Semitic movement, he is within two links of itthrough two different connections: via Wagner to the latter’s son-in-law HoustonStewart Chamberlain, and via his own sister to his brother-in-law Foerster, whowas an anti-Semite politician. From a network point of view, it is no surprise thatNietzsche’s philosophy became associated with this movement.7. Wagner was in the first wave of those who recognized Schopenhauer in themid-1850s, sending him the Ring libretto, as yet musically unscored, with adedication. Schopenhauer replied politely but preferred, as a musical traditionalist,Mozart and Rossini; he suggested that Wagner had more genius as a poet (Safranski,1989: 347).8. The king of Bavaria had inherited in 1864 a palpably weak state in the geopoliticsof the day, soon to be swallowed up in the unified German Empire through thewars of 1866–1871. His status equalization with Wagner is a case of aristocracyon the downward track meeting the market star on the upward slope. Wagner onhis side was vituperatively scornful of musicians who let the popular market dictatetheir musical style, singling out Meyerbeer for connivance with the cliques andeven bribery associated with his success at the Paris Opéra. Wagner’s anti-Semitismoriginated in this rivalry with the commercially more successful Meyerbeer.9. Lindenfeld (1980: 115–116). Ehrenfels also was an ardent Wagnerian and a memberof the Wagner network (thereby linking Kafka indirectly to Nietzsche), and afriend of Wagner’s son-in-law, the social Darwinist–racist H. S. Chamberlain.Given the oppressiveness of anti-Semitism in Kafka’s milieu, Ehrenfels showed hisidiosyncrasy by concluding that the solution to racial decadence was free-breedingsexuality by means of polygamy.1022 • Notes to Pages 768–77210. Lacan, in the Sartre literary circle of the 1940s, went on to become a leading figureof the 1970s and 1980s with his further synthesis of psychoanalysis with literarytheory.11. Another literary niche, lowbrow entertainment for the working class, had alwaysexisted, but was never a prestige motivator for intellectuals. Under modern marketconditions, aspirants for the highbrow market have lumped together everythingbeneath their own standards, denigrating middle-class audience-oriented writingsas if they were indistinguishable from penny dreadfuls.12. Contemporary evidence too shows that most professional writers make very littleincome, and support themselves from other jobs; only a small fraction make adecent living by writing (Kingston and Cole, 1986).13. Once a critical mass is attained, the visible production of avant-garde works,together with the palpable social milieu where intellectual values are held in highesteem by concentrated groups, makes such a center a mecca for internationalmigrants. Other cities which locally passed the critical mass and became intellectualcenters within their own language zone—London, St. Petersburg, Vienna, NewYork City, San Francisco—generally have been attractors only from their nationalhinterlands. This operated for Paris too; aspirant Frenchmen such as Rimbaudmade the trek from the provinces. Paris alone became an international attractorfor literary intellectuals: Germans such as Heine and Marx in the 1830s and 1840s;Russians such as Turgenev and Herzen in the 1850s; the Uruguayan IsidoreDucasse, who published under the French pseudonym Lautréamont in the 1870s;and a veritable lemming movement of American and British writers in the 1920s,not to mention Spaniards (Unamuno, Picasso), Latin Americans, and Russianexiles. It is notable that Germany has had less literary- geographical concentrationthan other language zones. German intellectual production was dominated byuniversities since their reform, and these kept up a decentralized network ofcompetition among some 20 centers. International sojourners in Germany had novery central target, but wandered throughout the system.14. Cohen-Solal (1987: 52–75); Biemel (1964). De Beauvoir’s pioneering feministwork, The Second Sex (1949), comes at the height of the existentialist group’s fameand its period of most intense political activity. Independent credit for creativitygoes only to those individuals who mark out a distinctive turf; de Beauvoir, whohad long contributed anonymously to the energy of the Sartre circle, now finds aniche in which its themes of authenticity and rebellion can be applied withoutforcing her into a break with her friends. Camus and Merleau-Ponty, by contrast,find the path to independence only at the cost of splitting from the group.15. This account is drawn from numerous sources (Boschetti, 1985: 88; Lacouture,1975: 163–165; Lebesque, 1960: 165; Cohen-Solal, 1987: 111–116). Groethuysen,originally Dutch, had studied under Dilthey at Berlin, and from the 1920s directedGallimard’s pacesetting literary magazine, Nouvelle Revue Française; he was anintimate friend of the chief literary figures of the 1920s and 1930s, Gide andMalraux, and acted as political-intellectual inspiration to the latter. It was theGallimard intellectuals who shaped Sartre’s path, turning the manuscript of hisfirst novel from a naturalistic shocker in the style of Céline, full of raw sexuality,Notes to Pages 773–775 • 1023into a metaphysical novel. Sartre’s original psychological title, Melancholia, waschanged to Nausea by the Gallimard staff to play up the theme of ontologicalunfoundedness.16. Perhaps it is no surprise that Durkheim, who first formulated the general theoryof the group worshipping sacred symbols of itself, was also a product of the ENS.17. It was in Koyré’s journal, Recherches philosophiques that Sartre published his firstphilosophical work, “The Transcendence of the Ego,” in 1936. Within the mainline of French academic philosophy, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, Aron, and most othersin the group had been taught by Léon Brunschwicg (who earlier had also taughtKoyré and Piaget). Brunschwicg had a career similar to Bergson’s: a pupil ofBoutroux at the ENS, he spent 19 years teaching at one of the elite Paris lycéesand was active in the group involved in academic reform in the early 1900s, beforearriving at the Sorbonne. Brunschwicg taught the French lineage of spiritualismand Idealist epistemology descending from Renouvier, Maine de Biran, and Ravaisson;it was against the Idealism of this position that Sartre’s generation rebelled.Sources on these network connections (Wagner, 1983: 156, 161; Lindberg, 1990:14–18; Boschetti, 1985: 83–92, 210; Fabiani, 1988: 20, 100, 116; EP, 1967: 2:545,7:482; Spiegelberg, 1982).18. Merleau-Ponty ([1945] 1962: xiv) makes the same point in his existential revisionof phenomenology: “The most important lesson that reduction teaches us is theimpossibility of a complete reduction.”19. “The result of our inquiry so far is therefore as follows: in relation to a possibleobject, the pure self-reverting activity of the self is a striving; and as shown earlier,an infinite striving at that. This boundless striving, carried to infinity, is thecondition of the possibility of any object whatsoever: no striving, no object” (Fichte[1794–1797] 1982: 231). Immediately preceding, Fichte had stated that the selfnever can conform to the not-self, since that would overturn the original negation.20. Another version of this dialectic had been enunciated in France only a few yearsbefore Sartre. Meyerson, a German-trained scientist whose circle includedBrunschwicg, Lévy-Bruhl, and Koyré, in well-known works published in 1908 and1921 had argued that science expresses the inexhaustible drive of the human mindto make reality intelligible, although nature always remains independent; theempirical is ultimately irrational. Furthermore, the essence of rational explanationis causality, the principle of sufficient reason; and “the principle of causality issimply the principle of identity applied to the existence of objects in time” (quotedin Copleston, 1950–1977: 9:282). To establish causality fully would be to deduceevery phenomenon from its antecedents, which would be equivalent to removingthe independent standing of entities and reducing them to a timeless Parmenideanimmutability. (Thus far Meyerson resembles Dharmakirti’s Buddhist dissolution ofentities through omni-causality.) But this is impossible; the human mind, expressedin its most rational form in science, strives for an unattainable unity. In his 1921work Meyerson explicitly relates his argument to Hegel’s philosophy of nature.21. Here too Sartre betrays his conviction that only the artist lives a life of authenticfreedom and meaning; it is beauty and art which is the union of essence andexistence, and thus the only equivalent to God (Sartre, 1943: 244).1024 • Notes to Pages 776–77822. “It was unthinkable: to imagine nothingness you had to be there already, in themidst of the World, eyes wide open and alive; nothingness was only an idea in myhead, an existing idea floating in this immensity: this nothingness had not comebefore existence, it was an existence like any other and appeared after many others.I shouted ‘filth! what rotten filth!’ and shook myself to get rid of this sticky filth,but it held fast and there was so much, tons and tons of existence, endless: I stifledat the depths of this immense weariness. And then suddenly the park emptied asthrough a great hole, the World disappeared as it had come, or else I woke up.”(Sartre, [1938] 1964: 134). Camus’s Myth of Sisyphus explicitly refers to Sartre’snausea as the absurd, following Sartre’s lead (Sartre, [1938] 1964: 129), andsuccinctly sums up the nub of Sartre’s position (without attributing it to him):“These two certainties—my appetite for the absolute and for unity and the impossibilityof reducing this world to a rational and reasonable principle—I also knowI cannot reconcile them” (Camus, [1942] 1955: 38). This was published in 1942,before Sartre had finished his 1943 masterwork, and before Camus personallyknew Sartre. The materials for combining the literary and philosophical traditionsmust have been in the air. Sartre had already formulated the literary version ofmetaphysical omni-contingency and unfoundedness in his 1938 novel, before hehad acquired the Hegelian and Heideggerian tools worked out in L’Être et le Néant.For both authors, subsequent creativity was a matter of working out furtherconsequences from this starting point: for Camus, a lineage of literary and politicalrebellion; for Sartre, a full-scale phenomenological dialectic of self-deception andauthenticity.23. Maritain’s 1948 Existence and the Existent (which he published at age 66) arguesthat Thomism is the only authentic existentialism (Herberg, 1958: 26–28, 155–157; EP, 1967: 5:153–155, 160–164; Boschetti, 1985: 89; Friedmann, 1981–1983).Among the theologians retrospectively labeled “existentialist,” Buber is the mostidiosyncratic. His academic parentage was mainline, as pupil of Brentano andDilthey at Vienna and Berlin at the turn of the century. As editor of a Zionistjournal during 1901–1926, he promoted Hasidism as the distinctively Jewishcontribution to universal religious experience. Buber balanced uneasily betweenpolitical Zionists and the secular Jewish assimilationists, writing in a universalisticvein on the classics of Eastern and Western mysticism. After 1913 he convertedfrom mysticism to a religion of everyday Existenz (what Weber would call “innerworldlymysticism”), then shifting to the dialogue of I and Thou, which Buberdrafted in 1916 and published in 1923. Again, it was only in the late 1940s thatBuber became famous as an existentialist, and published in his old age works(Between Man and Man, 1947; Eclipse of God, 1952) which brought out thatidentification. Originally Sartre branched off from the network of this same theologicaltransformation. Raised by his maternal grandparents, of the AlsatianSchweitzer family of liberal Protestants involved for generations in secular pedagogy,Sartre would have known from childhood of the family’s intellectual star, hiscousin Albert Schweitzer. Schweitzer’s Search for the Historical Jesus in 1906 haddemolished the liberal interpretation of Jesus as an ethical teacher in favor ahistorical picture of Christ as apocalyptic prophet. Schweitzer was trained by theNotes to Page 779 • 1025main German networks in theology and philosophy, as pupil of Windelband atStrasbourg and of Harnack, Simmel, Paulsen, and Stumpf at Berlin. Like hisyounger cousin, Schweitzer was a hybrid across fields, combining academic scholarshipwith eminence as a musician and as a medical missionary.24. “There were those idiots who came to tell you about will-power and the strugglefor life. Hadn’t they ever seen a beast of a tree? This plane-tree with its scalingbark, this half-rotten oak, they wanted me to take them for rugged youthfulendeavour surging towards the sky . . . Impossible to see things that way. Weaknesses,frailties, yes. The trees floated. Gushing towards the sky? Or rather acollapse; at any instant I expected to see the tree-trunks shrivel like weary wands,crumple up, fall on the ground in a soft, folded, black heap. They did not want toexist, only they could not help themselves . . . For every existing thing is bornwithout reason, prolongs itself out of weakness and dies by chance” (Sartre, [1938]1964: 133).25. The balance between unbelief and religion comes off best in Beckett’s Waiting forGodot, a popular production in 1956 when existentialism was dying. Beckett, whocame from the old anglophone émigré circle of James Joyce, suppressed existentialistpolitical resonances in favor of religious nostalgia. Sartre’s protégé Genetexploited Camus’s track in the other direction, making metaphysical rebellion aprimarily political theme in The Balcony (1958), The Blacks (1959), and TheScreens (1961), which plays up the Algerian rebellion, a subject that Camus hadavoided.26. Camus ([1951] 1956: 22). He comments (p. 8) that the experience of the absurdis “the equivalent, in existence, of Descartes’ methodical doubt.”27. Separation between Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, too, came ultimately from divergentinterests in intellectual space. Both discovered the same cultural capital, Husserlianphenomenology; in extracting opposite uses from it they were able to createdistinctive pathways for themselves. “One day, [Merleau-Ponty] discovered whathe had been looking for, intentionality . . . The same year, in Berlin, I also cameacross intentionality in [Husserl’s] Ideen, but what I wanted from it was more orless the opposite of what Merleau-Ponty had been looking for: I wanted it to ridconsciousness of all its slags, of all its ‘states’” (Sartre, quoted in Cohen-Solal,1987: 343). Merleau-Ponty, by contrast, used intentionality as grounds for his ownconception of human spontaneity, a rival to what would become Sartre’s dialecticof freedom through negation. Merleau-Ponty’s chief phenomenological works werepublished in 1942 and 1945, very close to the appearance of Sartre’s masterworkin 1943. Merleau-Ponty came into fully independent standing in the attention spaceonly after he ceased collaborating with Sartre in editing Les Temps Modernes, withhis Adventures of the Dialectic (1955) and Signs (1960).15. Sequence and Branch in the Social Production of Ideas1. Dharmakirti describes a student learning philosophy by reading a text at histeacher’s house, repeating it, and learning it by heart (Stcherbatski, [1930] 1962:1026 • Notes to Pages 779–794523); this method of teaching was going on at the height of innovation in Buddhistphilosophy.2. Gibbon, with characteristic eloquence and bias, puts it: “A cloud of critics, ofcompilers, of commentators, darkened the face of learning, and the decline ofgenius was soon followed by the corruption of taste” (The Decline and Fall of theRoman Empire; Gibbon, [1776] 1956: 52).3. The arithmetic formulated in the early Roman Empire, at the same time asnumerology, and indeed connected with the concerns for occult divination in auniverse of numerological correspondences, also made substantive advances innumber theory. This shows that there was a combination of two processes; theiroverlap in the case of Nicomachus led to some mathematical discovery, whereasin other parts of the Greek Cabalistic world and in the correlative cosmologies ofChina, the result was primarily occultist classification.4. There are processes of conceptual development within mythology which I willmake no attempt to deal with here. Lévi-Strauss’s structuralism emphasizes interactionsacross the border between humans and animals. These themes are characteristicof relatively unstratified, kinship-structured tribal and band societies,in which totemic animals are emblems of group membership. The mythologies ofhigh gods, as in the Vedic and Greek pantheons, are typical of politically organizedsocieties with ruling kings. Here the fragmentary and episodic narratives of tribalmyth give way to longer coherent narratives stressing the psychological motivationsof their characters, implying the working of professionalized entertainers,whose minds are made sophisticated by the frontstage Goffmanian settings onwhich they perform (Schneider, 1993: 83–113). Thus a degree of abstractionand reflexivity emerges already within the sequence of mythologies, although weknow little about what kinds of networks among mythology specialists were responsible.5. The notorious burning of the books which took place just before the founding ofthe Han dynasty is an extreme example of external political forces intruding todeny the autonomy of the intellectual attention space. It is no surprise that Hanintellectuals responded by moving in a particularistic direction.6. As I noted in Chapter 10, note 5, the use of the modern term “science” isanachronistic. But all abstract terms which we use for analyzing history are tosome degree anachronistic. The point is to be clear on what we are talking about.The present discussion makes the relevant distinctions.7. That is not so say that developments in scientific theories never change the levelof abstraction. Most Kuhnian paradigm shifts (Ptolemaic to Copernican astronomy,phlogiston to oxygen chemistry) stay at the same level of abstraction; butsome new theories shift to higher abstract levels and occasionally introduce reflexivity(Maxwell’s non-representational electromagnetic equations, Einsteinianrelativity, Heisenberg quantum mechanics). This kind of shift occurs primarilywhen scientific theories are based on higher mathematics, a field which has its ownabstraction-reflexivity sequence.8. This is one of the characteristics of occultism: once formulated, it remains fixed atNotes to Pages 796–807 • 1027a constant level of the abstraction-reflexivity sequence, changing if at all by accretionof concrete contents in its systems of divination and correspondence.9. Cases emerging from the analytical camp include Robert Nozick’s PhilosophicalExplanations (1981) and David Lewis’s On the Plurality of Worlds (1986), whichturns possible-worlds logic into a metaphysics of “modal realism”—all possibleworlds really exist.10. I am using the term “skepticism” in the specific sense of an omni-critical viewagainst the possibility of knowledge, a stance often manifested in the display ofunresolvable paradoxes. I do not use “skepticism” in the loose sense of oppositionto magical superstition or religious supernaturalism; it is better to reserve the term“secular rationalism” or “naturalism” for such attitudes.11. Krishna (1991: 42) notes that the conception of doubt, as it arises in debates, isintegral to the very definition of philosophy in the Indian tradition. “Doubt orsamshaya arises because there is vipratipatti, i.e. two opposite positions seem tobe supported by equally weighty arguments. It is true that the word ‘philosophy’is not a Sanskrit word, but there is no reason to suppose there is no Sanskritanalogue to it in the Indian tradition.”12. The question of possible transmission of influences is not a significant one for ourpurposes, since the cogito is used in different contexts and for different purposes.13. In Kant’s case, the backdrop is Hume’s more limited skepticism regarding causality.In Royce’s, the catalyst is Peirce’s criticism that Cartesian doubt is impossible, sincehuman consciousness is always in the midst of a chain of sensations and signs,within which clear-cut doubt is an artificial construction.14. Unlike other deep troubles, especially the problems of being and plurality, orsubstance and its relations, which are discovered quite early in the network sequencesand recycle repeatedly thereafter at each higher level of abstraction, thecogito starts off in the mid-periods of these sequences. That is because the cogitohinges on the recognition not merely of abstract concepts, but of a considerabledegree of reflexivity.15. This is a theme not much explored in the West, where Platonic influence labelednegation mere privation of being. After the collapse of Neoplatonic influence,negation was finally made prominent in the dialectic of Fichte and Hegel, pavingthe way for the ontological use of negation by Heidegger’s and Sartre’s existentialism.An episodic parallel to Dignaga is the medieval Christian philosopher Henryof Ghent, who in order to avoid using matter as the source of individuationdescribed individuation as a double negation: negation of all differences within theparticular thing, and negation of identity with other things. A generation laterEckhart made negation central to his non-Platonic formulation of Christian mysticism:God is so far above being that we can say nothing about him; humanexistence is so low that it is virtually nothing; and these two nothings convergein a divine spark. Apart from these ontological uses of negation, a parallel toBhartrihari’s and Dignaga’s theories of language shows up in the structuralism ofSaussure, in which words are arbitrary markers of difference within a system oflanguage. (There is a further parallel insofar as Bhartrihari gives ontologicalprecedence to what Saussure called parole, the acts of speaking, over langue, the1028 • Notes to Pages 810–822formal system of oppositions, which Bhartrihari and Dignaga regard as the sourceof illusion.) The structuralist-postmodernist emphasis on “difference” adds anontological tone that is not far from the original Buddhist conception of worldillusion arising through name-and-form.16. In other words, Indian intellectual life incorporated into about 200 years a rangeof arguments that spread over 600–700 years in Europe. This should cast doubton our image of the West as uniquely dynamic intellectually. Everywhere the paceof argument on the abstraction sequence is stalled from time to time by externalfactors. Such periods occur not only in the East (e.g., in India, the period after1500) but in the West as well, where the Renaissance period, 1400–1600, is largelya diversion from the abstract philosophy of the medieval Christian universities.European philosophy after 1600, its own ideological assertions to the contrarynotwithstanding, to a large extent revived and continued the higher levels ofabstraction attained by medieval scholasticism. We can add to this interruption the1300s, when the higher levels of scholasticism were obscured from being transmittedfurther by conditions which are explained in the Coda to Chapter 9. To makethe comparison fair, we should take account of the fact that the parallels to modernEuropean philosophy begin in India around 550–750, the time of Bhartrihari,Dignaga, Dharmakirti, Prabhakara, and Shankara. Indian philosophy from about800 to 1100 seems in a slowdown compared to the half-dozen generations precedingand following, probably owing to external conditions affecting the base ofintellectual life (discussed in Chapter 5 in relation to the conditions for the popularityof tantric magic). If we could subtract the dead spots from both sequences,we might say that the parallel between India around 500–1300 and Europe about1200–1900 boils down to a comparable number of generations in each duringwhich the networks had enough continuity to keep the abstraction-reflexivitysequence moving.17. Thus Heidegger’s and Sartre’s radical particularism was constructed in reaction toHusserl’s radical realism of universals, so to speak—Husserl’s program of searchingfor the deepest levels of formal ontological structures framing experience. This isa typical case of innovation by split within a creative network, and of creation bynegating a rival’s central premise.18. The question of the sincerity of faith sometimes raised about famous figures onthe religious-philosophical divide is doubly useless. To ask whether Ockham orDescartes was sincere in his professions of religious faith or only adopting aprotective mask is to ignore the structural situation which such individuals occupy:it is precisely because they are transforming the deep troubles of the argumentspace that they are not easily categorized on one side or the other. From amicro-sociological viewpoint, the question of sincerity is naive. Thinking takesplace by the flow of emotional energies focused in intellectual networks, recombiningwithin a thinker’s mind ideas representing membership in particular camps.The creative thinker is making and transforming alliances in the realm of symbols.In struggles of faith versus reason, creative developments fuse concepts which cutacross both sides of the struggle. It is possible, of course, that a philosopher’s internalconversation might include discussions about what it would be politic to sayNotes to Pages 825–831 • 1029in public. But prolonged hiding of one’s inner thoughts is difficult, above all in theintellectual world, where rituals of communication are the taps controlling itsenergy flow. When the philosopher publicly states a position—such as the doubletruth, or the compatibility of conceptual innovations with religious orthodoxy—the ritualistic process of repeating it before an audience generates further emotionalenergy, which makes these ideas still more dominant in the internal conversation.Successful thinkers cannot be Machiavellian about their creativity for very long;as their ideas become publicly known, the result is self-indoctrination.19. There are seven often-used types of proofs of God, together with proofs of anothersix auxiliary questions (Davidson, 1987; EP, 1967: 2:147–155, 232–237, 324–326,3:345–348, 6:538–541, 7:84–87; Sextus Empiricus, 1949: 1:13–194). Their distributionthroughout world history confirms the importance of the monotheist context.There are two lay-oriented proofs. Common consent of mankind: Cicero,Seneca, Clement of Alexandria; widely used in the 1600s by Cherbury, Gassendi,Grotius, Hooker, and the Cambridge Platonists. In India it appears in the Nyaya-Vaisheshika commentary of Udayana (1000 c.e.). This is a popularistic argumentfor the laity; it has been applied to defending both polytheism and monotheism,and was attacked as early as the Greek Sophists, Stoics, and Skeptics. Teleologyor design (the harmonious order of the world implies a maker): Socrates (asrecorded by Xenophon), Plato, the Christian Fathers; included by Saadia, Maimonides,and Aquinas in their compendia; especially emphasized in Europe of the1700s with Butler and Paley. It has been most prominent in the context ofreconciling science and religion. This type of argument does not arise in Asia, asit implies an anthropomorphic God and is senseless in connection with mysticism,which declares the lower world an illusion, or in connection with an immanentworld order as in the Chinese cosmologies. Both of these proofs are metaphysicallylimited, implying nothing about God’s perfection and unity, or about creation ofthe world ex nihilo.There are three metaphysical proofs. Cosmological, whose subtypes includefrom motion: Aristotle’s proof of the existence of an unmoved Mover, Stoics; andfrom causality: allied with auxiliary arguments, used as proofs of God by medievalMuslims and Jews, Aquinas, Descartes, Locke. From relative perfection (comparativedegrees of perfection implies a superlative): early Stoics, Augustine, Anselm,Aquinas, Descartes; Shankara gives an epistemological version. Ontological: IbnSina (arguing from contingency); Anselm’s version was widely used, discussed, andrejected in medieval Christian philosophy, revived by Descartes, Spinoza, andLeibniz, and critically discussed down through Frege and Russell. Technical philosophershave found this the most metaphysically stimulating proof because itacutely raises the issue of reflexivity. The ontological proof does not appear inIndia, owing to the anti-conceptual stance toward the highest reality dominantsince the rise of Advaita.There are two post-metaphysical proofs. Moral: Kant (the ideal of the highestgood implies a source outside the human individual). From religious experience:Schleiermacher, James. These arguments result from Kant’s critique cutting offmetaphysical arguments, especially the cosmological and ontological proofs.1030 • Note to Page 883Auxiliary proofs: of the unity, perfection, infinity, incorporeality of God; ofcreation ex nihilo (rejecting the eternity of the world substance); of the immortalityof the soul. These proofs are the key to distinguishing arguments for transcendentmonotheism from arguments for polytheism and pantheism. Some of these proofsbegan with the late Christian Neoplatonists; they developed most widely in medievalIslamic and Jewish philosophy.20. Monotheism is not a primordial concept of popular religion; nor does it come fromprofessional priests, whose politics tends toward compromise into pantheons. Ittakes the drive toward abstraction in a competitive intellectual community topurify the concept of divinity into ontological monotheism. This is why monotheismtends to appear well into the middle generations of an intellectual sequence.But there is nothing within intellectual dynamics to stabilize at the point ofanthropomorphic monotheism. Where it occurs, such monotheism is the result ofthe combination of internal intellectual trends with external social conditions ofthe kind noted by Weber and Durkheim. These are, respectively, the dominance ofan imperial state (or in the case of the war confederation of ancient Israel,aspiration to such a state), which raises the primary god of a pantheon above theothers (Weber), and the universalization which goes with increasing social differentiation(Durkheim). Comparative evidence is presented by Swanson (1962).21. A deep trouble like the Indian satkaryavada versus asatkaryavada, however, woulddivide the attention space into only two positions, whereas the law of smallnumbers provides room for three to six. Deep troubles are the most important ofthe factors dividing the attention space, but not the only one.22. For instance Epicureans, dropping to a lower level of concreteness, solved theproblem of causal relations among independent atoms by fiat, asserting that theatoms swerved into one another’s courses, thereby setting off the formation of thevisible universe.23. A shift is visible at the point where Christianity began to formulate a theology ata generalized level. The disputes about the relations among the parts of the Trinity,which took up much of the attention between 190 and 530 c.e., were a versionon the moderately abstract plane of theology of the deep trouble of the pluralityof substances. The first of these disputes, the Monarchian heresy, may be regardedas the discovery of a puzzle space on which an intellectual community of Christiantheologians could form. In this light, the outburst of heresy fights was an indicationnot of the weakness of Christianity, but of its institutionalization.24. Buddhism also developed a theist side. Mahayana added the worship of Boddhisattavasplus a sequence of future and past incarnations of the Buddha, including thedoctrine of the Buddha’s three bodies, one of which is the body of the universe.But these movements toward anthropomorphism did not produce the conceptionof a creator God; and the doctrines of Mahayana philosophies denied that therewas any world-substance to be created.25. The traditional practice of intellectual historians when noting parallels among ideasis to search for ways that influence could have been transmitted (e.g., ways inwhich Hume could directly or indirectly have heard of al-Ghazali’s discussion ofcausality). For reasons argued earlier (Chapter 8, notes 6 and 15), such influencesNotes to Pages 835–843 • 1031are usually overstated; this approach also omits consideration of why intellectualsin one community would be motivated to pay attention to arguments from elsewhere.We should notice the difference in the intellectual organization of twoscholarly enterprises: historians typically operate on a fairly modest level of theabstraction-reflexivity sequence, with a concrete conception of intellectual causality(an idea is transmitted from one person to another). Sociological analysis operatesat a somewhat more abstract level, looking for the general principles which explainintellectual production, and hence taking similarities in ideas as a challenge to findsimilarities in conditions within intellectual life.26. A foreshadowing of this came with Cusanus in the mid-1400s, at the very beginningof the mathematical revolution. Cusanus describes the world by extendinggeometrical forms to infinity, where all forms merge into one another; hence thefamous formulation that the universe is a sphere whose circumference is nowhereand its center everywhere. Leibniz turns every physical and logical quality intopositions along a continuum: rest is infinitely slow motion; equality is infinitelysmall differences.27. Despite the many parallels between the higher levels of the abstraction-reflexivitysequence in India and in Europe, there are no distinctions made between a prioriand a posteriori, and between analytical and synthetic, in Indian philosophy(Potter, [1963] 1976: 259). This is a consequence of the divergence betweenmathematical and philosophical networks in India, and their convergence inEurope.28. It is more than straws in the wind that Derrida comes from the later generationsof the Husserl network and that his first publication (Derrida, 1962) was onHusserl’s work on the philosophy of geometry.29. There have been no specifically anti-mathematical philosophies in the traditions ofChina and India because mathematics was never a significant part of those philosophicalnetworks.Epilogue1. There are other kinds of thinking, such as in imagery, but these are not at issuehere; it is thinking in verbal statements which yields some irrefutably true statements.2. What this argument does not prove is that space must have three dimensions. Thevarious numbers of dimensions conjectured in physics such as string theory arecompatible with the argument so far developed.3. And since thinking depends on the meaning of concepts, it is impossible to formulatethe notion of dreaming unless one is embedded in a discourse which distinguishesdreaming from waking experience. Dreaming could not exist if non-dreamingdid not exist.4. In medias res passes the test of Cartesian doubt. To deny in medias res is still toaffirm an instance of it in the very act of thinking the denial.5. I am not disputing here whether such translation can in fact always be carried out;the point is merely that translation does not escape from discourse. In social1032 • Notes to Pages 851–865experience, translation is a merging between two networks. Quine’s argument, thatthere is a multiplicity of different possible translations among languages, may wellnot be applicable to mathematical translations, for reasons that will becomeapparent.6. If we do not in fact arrive at the same total, we assume that someone has made amistake, has carried out the operation wrongly; this is to say that we did not bothfollow the convention.7. The comparative sociology of networks casts light on how this conception ofmathematics arose. Plato’s faction within the Greek networks was an alliancebetween mathematicians and philosophers, whose creativity came from tensionwith opposing factions of empiricists, materialists, and skeptical relativists. SubsequentPlatonic and Neoplatonic religions made mutually supporting argumentsout of the conception of a transcendent God, a hierarchy of degrees of universality,and mathematical Platonism. This combination of concepts was later taken overby the mainstream of Christian, Islamic, and Jewish philosophers, and has remainedavailable as a tradition for philosophy of mathematics into the secularizingperiod of European thought. In India and China no such mathematical Platonismarose, even with the prevalence of Idealist philosophy in India in the post-Buddhistperiod. This is due to the fact (documented in Chapter 10) that the networks ofmathematics and of philosophers had very few overlaps in China and India, unlikein Greece and the West.8. Since mathematics is also a genealogy of techniques, which took off in its ownrapid-discovery revolution in the generations between Tartaglia and Descartes, thedevelopment of mathematical-experimental paradigms in modern science has beenyet another kind of hybridization among genealogies of techniques. The lineagesof mathematics have branched and recombined among themselves, giving rise toa rich ecology of mathematical “species” which have cross-bred in various wayswith the similarly cross-breeding “species” of research equipment genealogies.9. That is, since the telegraph (first in 1837), and subsequently electric motors,telephones, lighting, and so on made it part of banal reality. Electricity had had amore restricted laboratory reality for researchers since the Leiden jar was inventedin the 1740s, and especially since the voltaic cell (1799), which produced a reliablecontinuous current. During the intervening period before laboratory equipmentwas widely exported into everyday life, there were many popular interpretationsof the reality of electricity (e.g., Mesmer’s, as well as religious interpretations),which lacked the sense of banal normalcy electricity was later to acquire.10. There is a family continuity between one generation of such concepts and the next,although just what constitutes such continuity does not appear to be specifiable ingeneral and in advance. Kuhn (1961) has argued that even in the massive conceptualshifts which he calls paradigm revolutions, the mathematics is preserved. Aswe have seen in the previous section, mathematics should be regarded as a practicaltechnique for making discoveries about formal intellectual operations; this meansthat once again what is preserved across the generations is not the ideas per se butthe continuity of yet another genealogy of research “equipment.” Mathematicalcontinuity and groundedness of scientific entities is another case of the continuityNotes to Pages 867–873 • 1033of practical time-space activity. Again we see an epistemological gap between thisreliable, materially existing but tacit practice and the verbal constructions andhuman-sized imagery which include the reified nouns and imputed substances oftheoretical scientific entities.11. Every mathematical article starts off with a verbal title and engages in verbalexplanations, however cryptic, of its problems before plunging into manipulatingits symbolism; at the other end, successful mathematics becomes part of the verbaldiscourse by which mathematicians summarize and point toward past accomplishmentsand future topics. Data illustrating this point for mathematical journals aregiven in Collins (1984).12. One version of the sociology of knowledge or sociology of science attempts toreduce knowledge produced by intellectuals to the ideological claims of externalgroups outside the network, for example, as reflection of class interests in thesurrounding society. Knowledge is sometimes constructed in this way. But layinfluence is not the main source of the social construction of specifically intellectualknowledge. The ideas of ordinary social discourse are on a lower level of abstractionthan ideas produced by intellectuals; and the creativity of intellectual networkscomes from creating topics and problems which arise not in the lay world at allbut primarily through the dynamics of attention-seeking within their inner socialspace. The externalist sociology of knowledge began with the conception of ideology,and thus with the tendency to regard sociology as explaining the source offalse beliefs. As sociology has begun to study the internal social communities ofintellectuals, it has come to encompass the social construction of true beliefs. Thesuspicion lingers that sociology means reducing true beliefs to false beliefs, althoughthis flatly contradicts what is asserted: the social construction of true beliefsis about true beliefs.13. Bloor’s “strong programme” (1978) is that of a Wittgensteinian philosopher;the local social constructivism of laboratory studies (e.g., Latour and Woolgar,1983) derived from a network which branched from the phenomenologists toethnomethodology, via Schutz and Garfinkel. The earlier sociology of knowledgeof Marx and Engels came from the Hegelian circle of the 1840s; Durkheim’s camefrom his personal confrontation between the neo-Kantianism and empiricist psychologyof his immediate predecessors.14. In one batch of manuscripts for journal review, I have read of the intersectionbetween the conceptions of Max Weber and Dostoyevsky, and between those ofDurkheim and Schopenhauer. Further cross-combinations of these and others areobvious. And each generation of literature makes possible new combinations inthe following generation.
